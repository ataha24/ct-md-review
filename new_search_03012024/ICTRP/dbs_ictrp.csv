The <br>PDNS performs a specific nursing assessment related to the medical, physical, <br>psychological and social domains.<br>2. Development of a patient-centered treatment plan that supports patients and <br>caregivers in self-management.

Subject determined to be treatment-resistant for at least one year prior to the<br>             Screening Visit as demonstrated by clinical evidence (determined by review of medical<br>             records and discussion with referring psychiatrist or neurologist) of persistent<br>             functionally impairing tics that have not responded to treatment with a minimum of<br>             three adequate regimens of medication including two failed trials of at least one<br>             typical neuroleptic and one atypical neuroleptic medication, along with one failed<br>             trial of a first tier medication as defined as follows:<br><br>               1. Adequate trials of one non-neuroleptic medication including drugs from the<br>                  following (first tier) list: clonidine, guanfacine, topiramate, baclofen,<br>                  levetiracetam, and clonazepam.

A portion of the study team,<br>             including the surgeon and two neurologists, will determine by consensus which category<br>             the subject falls into and whether the tics are a significant problem.<br><br>          6. All other aspects of the subject's care must be optimized during the preceding 6<br>             months before admission to the study. This includes treatment for comorbid medical,<br>             neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Additionally, it includes psychological<br>             interventions for any ongoing psychosocial problems the subject may have during the<br>             preceding 6 months before study admission.<br><br>          7. Subject must be ambulatory.<br><br>          8. Females who are postmenopausal, physically incapable of childbearing, or practicing an<br>             acceptable method of birth control. Acceptable methods of birth control include<br>             surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives, or double-barrier methods (condom or<br>             diaphragm with a spermicidal agent or intrauterine device [IUD]).

The implantation of deep brain stimulators takes approximately 3 to 6 hours. Deep brain stimulators are similar to cardiac pacemakers and the battery is placed - like in pacemakers - under the collar bone. However the electrodes are not in the heart but end in the brain where they stimulate certain areas of the brain - in our study the pallidum or globus pallidus internus. This part of the brain is involved in involuntary movements. We believe that continuous high frequency stimulation of this part of the brain can block involuntary movements and improve dystonia. The treatment group will receive effective continuous stimulation through their implanted deep brain stimulators for three months; The standard setting of the stimulator are pulse width of 90µs, 130 Hz and the highest possible amplitude , that does not cause side effects.
