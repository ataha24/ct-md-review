If they accept, later, they will be randomized into 2 groups of 18 individuals: Experimental Group (EG) and Placebo Group (GP). For the sample calculation, the primary outcome was the total value of the MiniBESTest. The study by Godi et al. (2020) demonstrated that the minimum clinically significant difference value is 3.4 points in the total value of the MiniBESTest. Using this value, for the statistical calculation of two-way ANOVA (between factors) an effect size of 0.44 of Cohen&apos;s F was found. With this, for the calculation we used the effect size of 0.44 of Cohen&apos;s F, type I error (alpha) of 5%, type II error (beta) of 80%, two groups, 3 moments (before training, after training and follow up) and correlation between repeated measures of 0.5. After the calculation, we reached the value of 15 patients per group. Accepting the possibility of 20% of possible sample loss, we will select 18 patients per group. For the calculation, the statistical software G*Power 3.1.9.7 (Universitat Kiel, Kiel, Germany) was used. Randomization will be generated by computer by an independent researcher not involved in the recruitment process or in the application of the intervention protocol, through randomization in blocks in order to guarantee balance in the number of participants between the groups, being: experimental (EG), which will receive the balance training protocol associated with the application of tDCS, or placebo (GP), which will receive the balance training protocol associated with tDCS-placebo.

They will primarily recruit through NHS clinics at Oxford University Hospital (OUH), Oxford and The Royal Free (London), community therapy teams and through schools. Clinical staff, the Community Physiotherapy Team and teachers will distribute the PIS to the potential participants and their parents/carers who may be eligible and interested in taking part in the study. They will also advertise through posters, social media and CP support groups/websites. The direct care team at OUH NHSFT (research site) will identify potential participants and pass information on to them (leaflet/PIS). Potential participants will then be asked by the direct care team to give verbal consent to be contacted by Oxford Brookes University (OBU) and University of Oxford researchers. The researchers will then contact the participants to go through the details of the study with them. It will be made clear to them that agreeing to have their contact details passed to the researchers does not oblige them to agree to take part.

It is proposed to work by polarising brain tissue beneath the stimulating electrodes. Usually applied over the motor cortex, TDCS can either increase (anodal) or suppress (cathodal) excitability depending on electrode configuration. In this study, TDCS will be applied over the cerebellum. The current will be applied at 2mA for 20 minutes in three separate sessions, one week apart. The order of the sessions will be randomised. Two sessions will be cathodal, andodal and  sham session. The randomisation order and the intervention will be applied by an independent investigator. Investigators who are collecting and analysing data will remaind blinded until the end of the study period.","Neurophysiological measures using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). TMS is used to test excitability of intracortical brain circuits, that are known to be affected in primary focal dystonia. A change in these measures more toward 'normal' (as measured by comparison to a healthy group) will indicate improvement.[Immediately post treatment]","Handwriting and circle drawing tasks will be used to assess kinematics before and after the intervention. An improvement in these tasks is expected. The measures of interest include stroke frequency, mean pen pressure and the Coefficient of Variation of positive velocity peaks (CV). These are calculated using computer software. The Handwriting task will also be analysed using the Writers Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) by an independent assesor.[Immediately post treatment]",,,,No,False,"          ",
