Then the process of randomization will be carried out using Random Allocation software version 1.0 (developed by the Department of Anaesthesia, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran). It is a randomization software for parallel group trials. It requires the total sample size and the total number of groups. We will add a total sample size of 42 participants and 3 groups into the software with only one block. The software generates an output file that can be opened with internet explorer. The output file contains a list of number along with assigned groups. In our case, the groups will be A, B, C with 14 participants in each group.

In the Pre-intervention period, the MMSE protocol will be administered and participants who have cognitive conditions will respond to the following instruments in the second stage: UPDRS scale, to assess motor and non-motor aspects of PD, “Time Up and Go Test” and the “Berg Balance Scale”, to assess gait quality and static and dynamic balance, respectively. In the third pre-intervention stage, individuals will be submitted to an “Electronystagmography” exam to assess the “latency” and “gain” of saccadic movement.

A diagnosis of probable AD (McKhann et al. 2011) or progressive supranuclear palsy-<br>             Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) (Höglinger et al. 2017).

History of significant cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, or hepatic disease (or<br>             laboratory evidence thereof);<br><br>          5. History of major psychiatric illness or untreated depression that in the opinion of<br>             the PI would pose a safety risk or interfere with the appropriate interpretation of<br>             study data;<br><br>          6.

Evidence of any clinically significant findings on Screening or baseline evaluations<br>             which, in the opinion of the PI would pose a safety risk or interfere with appropriate<br>             interpretation of study data;<br><br>          8. Current or recent history (within four weeks prior to Screening) of a clinically<br>             significant bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial infection;<br><br>          9. Current clinically significant viral infection;<br><br>         10. Major surgery within four weeks prior to Screening;<br><br>         11.

Any contraindication to or unable to tolerate lumbar puncture at Screening, including<br>             use of anti-coagulant medications such as warfarin. Daily administration of 81 mg<br>             aspirin will be allowed as long as the dose is stable for 30 days prior to Screening;<br><br>         13. Participants who, in the opinion of the PI, are unable or unlikely to comply with the<br>             dosing schedule or study evaluations;<br><br>         14. Prior treatment with BIIB092;<br><br>         15. Treatment with another investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives of drug<br>             before Screening, whichever is longer.
