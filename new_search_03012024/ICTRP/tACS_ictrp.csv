Also, we use a non-invasive, adaptive and<br /><br>controlled brain stimulation approach (transcranial alternating current<br /><br>stimulation; TACS) to test for the effect of inhibiting the motor cortex and<br /><br>cerebellum on tremor intensity (accelerometry) and, for the cerebellum, on<br /><br>tremor-related activity (EMG-fMRI) and (outcome #3). Previous research has<br /><br>shown powerful modulatory influences of TACS on both Parkinson*s tremor and ET. </p><br>",,,,Yes,False,"          ",
