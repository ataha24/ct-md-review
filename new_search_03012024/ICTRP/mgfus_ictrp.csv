Following the Nearme appointment, if the patient agrees to participate in the study they will be given an appointment to attend the MRgFUS thalamotomy clinic at Ninewells Hospital. At this appointment, informed consent will be taken and the patient will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This will include neurological and neuropsychiatric assessments. Following these assessments, the patient will have MRI and CT scans to map the structure of their brain, pinpoint the target for treatment, and determine the density of their skull. The patient will receive the results of these tests, and whether they are suitable for MRgFUS thalamotomy at a telephone consultation approximately 6 weeks after the screening appointment.

Treatment begins by acquiring a series of MR images of the target tissue. The physician then reviews the images on the ExAblate system workstation, identifies a target volume on the MR images, delineates the treatment contours on the images, and reviews the treatment plan. Therapy planning software calculates the parameters required to effectively treat the defined region. During the treatment, an ultrasound transducer generates a point of focused ultrasound energy, called a sonication.  The sonication raises the tissue temperature within a well-defined region, causing a thermal coagulation effect. MR images acquired during sonication provide a quantitative, real-time temperature map of the entire field-of-view around the target area to confirm the location of the sonication and the size of the coagulated region. The sonication process is repeated at multiple adjacent points to cover the entire prescribed treatment volume.","1. Safety   Safety of ExAblate will be determined by an evaluation of the incidence and severity of device / treatment related complications from the first treatment day visit through ALL study follow ups. Adverse events (type, frequency, severity) are expected to be similar to those of previous studies using ExAblate TcMRgFUS for Thalamotomy.   All AEs will be reported and categorized by investigators as definitely, probably, possibly, or unrelated to the device or procedure and categorized by treatment group / treatment arm.     2. Effectiveness     Primary effectiveness will be evaluated using a validated, tremor rating scale: the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremors (CRST) for ET subjects, based upon subjects in whom unilateral ExAblate lesioning is attempted (i.e., Intent-to-Treat analysis).     Clinical assessments will be made at the following time points:  screening, baseline with subjects on confirmed stable medication (at 1-months post screening), and post-treatment at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.","1.
