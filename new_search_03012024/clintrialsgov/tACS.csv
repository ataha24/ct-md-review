NCT05808504,Investigation of the Benefits of Electrical Non-invasive Stimulation on Cognitive Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05808504,STIMPARK,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease.

It is mostly characterized by the presence of motor difficulties. However, it can also be accompanied by cognitive disorders which have an equally significant impact on the quality of life of patients and which are not relieved by any treatment.

Among the functions affected by Parkinson's disease, inhibition is an essential process for adapting our behaviors in daily life. Inhibition allows us to stop an action that is no longer required or appropriate to the situation in which we find ourselves in. For example, it comes into play when we have to stop at a ""stop"" sign while driving.

Recent studies suggest that it could be possible to improve the functioning of these processes by using non-invasive brain stimulation tools. Transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation has thus showed promising results in improving functions such as working memory. This technique is completely painless and non-invasive and consists in applying an electric current of very low intensity (barely perceptible) at the level of the scalp, using electrodes.

The investigators are conducting a study to test whether transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation could improve the functioning of the inhibition process which is altered in patients. For this, the investigators will measure this process using a task performed on a computer (the Stop Signal Reaction Time Task), as well as brain activity using a method called ""electroencephalography"", before and after stimulation. For this study, the investigators will include 50 patients and 40 healthy participants to investigate the effect of the stimulation on inhibition.",NO,Parkinson Disease,OTHER: Neuropsychological assessment|OTHER: Neurological assessment|OTHER: Cognitive task|PROCEDURE: EEG|PROCEDURE: tACS (real or sham),"Difference in cognitive performance measured by the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) compared between real and sham stimulation conditions, 5 months","The difference in the dynamic changes in functional networks during the task between real and sham stimulation., The difference in the dynamic changes in functional networks during the task between real and sham stimulation measured by the averaged lifespan (in ms) if the networks identified with the weighted phase lag index., 5 months|The difference in network parameters derived from graph theory between real and sham stimulation., The difference in network parameters derived from graph theory between real and sham stimulation. measured by the functions of the brain connectivity toolbox (matlab) : degree distribution, path length, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient., 5 months|The existence of correlations between the changes in network measures between real and sham stimulation mentioned above and the behavioral differences measured between real and sham stimulation., Correlations will be calculated in R using the spearman rank correlations between (i) changes in network measures between real and sham stimulation : averaged network lifespan, degree distribution, path length, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, and (ii) behavioral differences in SSRT (ms)., 5 months",,"Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,90,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER)|Primary Purpose: OTHER",C21-76|2022- A00767-36,2023-04-15,2026-01-15,2026-01-15,2023-04-11,,2023-04-11,"CHU de Rennes, Rennes, France",

NCT03221413,Transcranial Alternating Current for Oscillopathies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03221413,tACS_EEG,COMPLETED,"The need for non-invasive, non-pharmacological and cost-effective therapeutic options has revived the use of transcranial current stimulation, either direct (tDCS) or alternating (tACS), in a wide range of pathologies and cognitive disturbances. Results, although often promising, are not unequivocal, possibly due to different stimulation parameters and sites, or non-homogenous patient selection. tDCS has been widely applied but few studies have focused on tACS which has the advantage of potentially entraining brain oscillations at the same frequency of stimulation. This overcomes the basic mechanism of tDCS which deploys anodal or cathodal currents to broadly excite or inhibit supposedly dysfunctional underlying cortex.

Whether a stimulation paradigm based on sound neurophysiological markers could provide a better and longer-lasting clinical outcome has not yet been ascertained.

The investigators aim to establish, with a trans-disease approach, categories characterized by defective EEG oscillatory activity and related dysfunctional networks. This classification, expected as the result of the first stage of this project, will guide the stimulation paradigm: categories with a pathologically low-band EEG prevalence will be treated with high-frequency tACS, and vice-versa, while the stimulation site will correspond to the defective sites of pathological EEG band maps. Parkinson's disease (PD), the EEG marker of which is a shift towards fast frequencies, and neuropathic pain (NP), with an EEG prevalence of slow bands, will be considered.

In order to categorize pathologies on the basis of their EEG frequencies, EEG power spectrums will be derived from resting EEG, and cortical oscillatory reactivity will be assessed by EEG-TMS (electroencephalographic-Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) co-registration. This method appears to elicit state-dependent brain oscillatory response and is expected to support power spectrum data. The identified prevailing EEG band will be used subsequently to reconstruct scalp EEG band distribution. tACS paradigms will be tailored according to these findings: the anode will be placed over the scalp area corresponding to the dysfunctional rhythm and frequency will be set in order to correct the prevailing EEG band (slow stimulation if fast frequencies prevail, and vice-versa).

The translational element of this research proposal will consist of its clinical application in day-to-day practice for the benefit of people with the target conditions. The patient-groups, after undergoing the neurophysiology studies, will be tested with disease-specific scales and a neuropsychological battery. A 2-weeks tACS, either real or active sham, protocol will then be performed (30 minutes/day, 5 days/week), associated with an ad hoc rehabilitation protocol (60 minutes/day 5 days/week). During the last day of stimulation, patients will be tested again with the disease specific scales, neuropsychological battery and standard EEG to detect EEG frequencies modifications.

NCT04509349,Alternating Current Stimulation for Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04509349,,UNKNOWN,"Movement disorders are common neurological disorders, characterized by either excess or paucity of movements. Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common of these disorders, defined as chronic, rhythmic involuntary movements (tremor) that occur primarily during action involving the upper extremities as prominent body site. ET occurs in between 0.4% and 4% of adults below age 60, its prevalence and related impairment of routine daily actions increasing dramatically with age. More than half of patients do not regain functional independence with medications. These patients are offered functional neurosurgical approaches that carry procedural risk or adverse effects secondary to deep electric stimulation of surgical lesioning. Hence, there is a substantial need for alternative, non-invasive therapeutic options for this disabling neurological disorder. Recently, non-invasive neuromodulation applied as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), has emerged as promising for tremor control. In healthy subjects, tACS applied with a high definition (or focused) montage to the primary motor cortex (M1), was found to entrain physiological tremor; in patients with Parkinson's disease, tACS could decrease the amplitude of rest tremor when the stimulation was delivered in phase with, and at the same frequency of, the tremor. Tremor in ET could also be entrained applying ACS to the arm skin's peripheral nerves (transcutaneous ACS), but its effect on tremor amplitude is unknown.

METHODS AND POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION/IMPACT OF THE RESEARCH.

The proposed project aims to explore the whole potential of tACS for the tremor suppression in ET. The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses:

1. focused (or high definition, HD) tACS delivered over M1 at the same frequency of the tremor is effective in decreasing tremor amplitude in ET;
2. this effect is strongest when the delivery of tACS is locked to the phase of the tremor expressed by the patient, i.e. administering tACS in a closed-loop modality;
3. transcutaneous ACS in the upper extremities is as effective as tACS applied to the scalp around M1.",NO,Essential Tremor,DEVICE: transcranial Altering Current Stimulation|DEVICE: Sham tACS,"Essential Tremor Severity Change, The tremor severity will be assessed in the participants by a Movement Disorders Neurologist., Right before and immediately after the intervention",,,University of Calgary,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,REB20-0889,2020-10-01,2021-10,2022-08,2020-08-12,,2020-09-02,,
NCT02346409,Cerebello-thalamo-cortical Coupling in Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02346409,CERESTIM,COMPLETED,"Essential tremor (ET) is a frequent and disabling disorder with progressive worsening of postural tremor of the upper limbs that impairs most of the manual activities of every day life (feeding, drinking, etc.). Although the pathophysiology of essential tremor (ET) is not fully elucidated, tremor is associated with abnormal activity within different brain regions, in particular the thalamus and the cerebellum. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM-Thal) reverses the symptoms of tremor but is an invasive procedure. Transcranial stimulation of the cerebellum may represent a non-invasive therapeutic option for ET patients. Here, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of cerebellar stimulation in 15 ET patients previously operated for DBS of the thalamus. To further understand how this treatment provokes tremor reduction, the investigators will analyse the brain neuronal activity in 13 others ET patients candidate to thalamic DBS by using combined electrophysiological recordings of the thalamus (with the electrodes implanted), the cerebellum and the cortex with magnetoencephalography.",NO,Essential Tremor,DEVICE: tACS of the cerebellum,"The neuronal activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway, LFP, MEG and EMG activity recordings, 1 day",,,"Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,C14-44|2014-A01393-44,2015-02-04,2018-02-16,2018-02-16,2015-01-27,,2021-08-30,"ICM, Paris, 75013, France",
