NCT03339908,Regional Non-comparative Prospective Study of the Impact of Gamma Knife Radiosurgery on Tremor in Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03339908,GK-SEP,COMPLETED,"Multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, affects approximately 100,000 peoples in France. It is the leading cause of disability in young adults. Tremor is a common symptom (25-58% of patients depending on the series) and can be particularly disabling. The drug treatments against tremor are ineffective or insufficient. Deep brain stimulation of the Vim (Small nucleus within thalamus) and stereotactic radiofrequency thalamotomy have shown their efficacy in this indication. However, in some cases these invasive procedures are impossible because of operational risk. Gamma knife thalamotomy can be an alternative choice. This procedure, less invasive, mainly because of the absence of craniotomy is used by several teams of international reputation for over fifteen years, with good to excellent results in essential tremor. The team of Marseille, which has an experience of 22 years in Gamma Knife radiosurgery has treated 250 patients with severe tremor (essential tremor or Parkinson's disease) by a unilateral thalamotomy with an improvement of 70% of functional scores.

In the literature, no formal studies of the effect of Gamma Knife in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) tremor is reported. There are only a few cases without specific evaluation of the efficacy in this disease. Hence the importance of studying in detail the effects of this technique, which allows a precise and limited lesion volume. Using an isocenter of 4mm and a dose of 130 Gy radiation lesion obtained is limited to a volume of 200 to 500 mm3.

The aim of this study is to assess through a minimally invasive technique with a circumscribed and reproducible lesion volume, the effect of thalamotomy on the particular tremor in multiple sclerosis with a prospective evaluation of its effects.

Patients with MS with a disabling tremor will be included in the study. They will be assessed with neurological examination, quality of life scales, neuropsychological assessment, functional scores and cerebral MRI.

NCT04074031,Transcranial Ultrasound Therapy of Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04074031,ULTRABRAINTher,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Context. Essential tremor (ET) is a common disease, disabling in severe forms and resistant to drug treatment. In patients with severe ET, invasive neurosurgical technique such as deep brain stimulation of the Ventral Intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus is used. Focused ultrasound therapy, creating a small lesion of VIM represents an effective therapeutic alternative of low morbidity with the advantage of not requiring the opening of the skull and penetration into the brain. This therapy is performed under stereotactic guidance. Validation of the target before lesioning is done by testing the clinical effect by a gradual increase in temperature, resulting in tremor reduction. However, the gradual temperature increase in the targeting phase is suboptimal because it can decrease the efficiency of the lesioning procedure. The aim of this research project is to test an innovation of fundamental physics developed by the Langevin Institute, which would allow the reversible modulation of nerve tissue by ultrasonic waves without heating, to predict the effectiveness of treatment of the chosen target within the VIM before creating an irreversible lesion.

Methodology: Fifteen patients with severe and resistant essential tremor will be included in the study. A multimodal MRI will be performed for target calculation using several targeting methods for VIM developed during step 1. For each target, the application of neuro-modulation by ultrasound will allow determine the effect obtained on the tremor (quantified with adequate clinical scales - as Tremor rating scale (CRST), and the recording of electromyographic activity of the upper limbs) and the absence of side effects. A definitive millimetric lesion will be performed at the level of the most relevant target in order to maintain the clinical effect obtained. The procedure will be controlled by thermal MRI sequences. Post-therapy clinical and MRI multimodal follow-up will take place on D1, D7, M1, M2, M3, M6, M12 and M24.

Perspectives and Innovation: This project will test clinically the low intensity ultrasound neuromodulation jointly developed by the Langevin Institute and the Brain and Spine Institute ( ICM) in order to refine the targeting procedure of high intensity transcranial focused ultrasound therapy. In perspective, reversible neuromodulation performed in vivo in humans represents a considerable advance in the exploration and future treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases such as depression.

Its prevalence is about 1/200 implying that at least 300 000 peoples are concerned in France. Its frequency increase with age (14% of patients 65 yo). The diagnostic criteria are postural and kinetic tremor that can be associated with head/voice tremor. ET induces a social impairment but also difficulties to perform any task requiring dexterity. With time, tremor can be so severe that every activity of daily living is impaired with loss of autonomy.

Treatment such as betablockers, primidone or antiepileptics might have some efficacy at the beginning. But as the severity of the tremor increases, there is lack of efficacy. Deep Brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus can be proposed. However, in case of medical or surgical contra-indication, Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery thalamotomy can be an alternative option.

Now, around 100 patients are treated annually in our unit (essential tremor or Parkinson tremor).

Clinical and radiological follow-up is demonstrating that 80% of these patients are presenting with a homogenous response complete or subtotal, the disappearance of the tremor mean delay of 6 months after radiosurgery. In neuroradiological responses on the MRI, is appearing roughly at the same time local contrast enhancement surrounding highty to signal no associated with clinical side effects.

In 15 to 20% of the patients, the clinical effets is not obtained and in the vast majority no MRI response or minimal MRI response is observed on images suggesting that these failures are related to specific resistance to radiosurgery of this subgroup.

In roughly 5% of the patients, at the contrary, hyper response is observe on the MRI rating clinically with side effects (hemiparesis or proprioceptive ataxia or dysarthria, hands problems....). The adverse effects are generally reversible either in whole or in part with the resorption of the perilesionnel oedema.

It would be extremely helpfull to be able to identify in advance these 2 groups of hyper and hypo respondeurs.

The capacity to identify in advance these patients at risk to hypo or hyper response would allow us to either contre-indicate radiosurgery or modify radiosurgery technicaly at the time of dose planing.

Sequently, these predictions would allow us to tailor individually mission management and information leading to improvment of the efficacy and tolerance of this kind of intervention.

The parameters suspected to be likely to influence the response are :

* genetics
* co-morbidities (diabetis, vascular...)
* Main aspect of the brain (severe atrophy, vascular, micro-infacts...)
* Chronobiological (timing during the day of the radiosurgical procedure)

To this end, the purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding a drug, amifostine, at the time of radiosurgery will protect patients from facial numbness.",YES,Trigeminal Neuralgia,DRUG: Amifostine|PROCEDURE: CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery,"Facial Numbness Following Radiosurgery, Percent of patients with facial numbness following radiosurgery will be determined at one year follow up., 1 year","Pain Relief Following Radiosurgery, Pain improvement as assessed by the Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) facial pain score from pre-treatment baseline of BNI 3-5 (3-some pain/controlled on medications, 4-some pain/not controlled on medications, 5-severe pain) to BNI 1-2 (1-no pain/ no medication, 2- occasional pain/no medication), 1 year",,Stanford University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,17,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,IRB-14896|SU-05252011-7806,2008-09,2014-01,2015-01,2011-06-02,2016-12-16,2017-04-04,"Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, 94305, United States",

Dose Escalation Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02585583,PRDBRS2,UNKNOWN,"The gamma knife radiosurgical thalamotomy to treat many movement disorders is recently becoming a new and well defined treatment paradigm.

The CyberKnife if compared to the frame-based radiosurgery, is a pain free procedure which offers the advantage of a better patient's compliance by avoiding local anaesthesia and the discomfort due to wearing the frame for the period of time needed for the whole procedure.

Unfortunately the subtle but substantial differences about the 3D dose distribution and the dose fall-off features between GK and CK made mandatory investigations about the effectiveness and the safety when the cyberknife is used.

Particularly the minimum effective and safety dose have to be defined yet A previous study (NCT02095600) failed in demonstrating the efficacy of 75 Gy, 80 Gy, 90 Gy.
