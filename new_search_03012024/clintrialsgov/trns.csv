NCT02323633,"Phase IIa Exploratory Clinical Trial, to Examine the Safety and Efficacy of tPCS on Paediatric ADHD Participants",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02323633,,UNKNOWN,"Children with ADHD display a certain brainwave profile which might be different to that of a child who does not have ADHD. Treatment with tPCS (transcranial pulsed current stimulation) has shown that this brainwave profile could possibly be altered to more closely resemble a brainwave profile of a child who does not have ADHD. Researchers believe that by changing this brainwave profile it might lessen symptoms of ADHD.

tPCS is a name used to describe the type of current this device produces. It involves randomly (in no specific pattern) produced pulses of current at different times that the brain picks up. These pulses of low current stimulate the brain in a certain way and affect the brainwave activity.

Treatment is given by applying a low frequency current using small electrodes clipped to the earlobes. The current comes from an external battery source. The pulses of current generated by this device stimulate certain parts of the brain which result in a possible increased control of attention and behaviour. This treatment has already been proven to be safe and will not hurt your child.

Due to these specific parts of the brain being stimulated, and the positive results of previous research, it seems possible to control certain functions in children suffering from inattention and hyperactivity.

The idea of using tPCS stimulation as a possible way for helping children with confirmed ADHD opens a new window to future research. The final goal of this device and research is to offer a safe, non-invasive (conservative treatment that does not require piercing into the body or the removal of tissue) treatment that can be used on a long-term basis and shows a clear improvement of ADHD symptoms for children and even adults with ADHD.",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,DEVICE: Braingear Brainbuds Pulsed Current stimulation device|DEVICE: Sham,"The primary efficacy objective will be measured by the change in scores from baseline to Day 42 in both the SNAP-IV-C and Connors'3 Parent Rating Scales, 42 days|Safety and tolerability will be measured by the incidence and severity of adverse events and changes in physical examination findings, vital signs and qEEG findings., 42 days","The secondary efficacy objective will be measured by the change in scores from baseline to day 42 in the psychometric analysis conducted by the psychometrist, 42 days|The change from baseline to day 42 in the electrophysiological observations of a qEEG., 42 days",,Braingear Technologies GmbH,Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital,ALL,CHILD,PHASE2,48,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,BGX-3006,2015-01,2015-06,2015-10,2014-12-23,,2014-12-23,,

Recent approaches that involve the application of non-invasive brain stimulation have the potential to strengthen the remaining connections between the brain and the spinal cord for improved hand function. Combining brain stimulation with performing upper limb functional tasks may further increase the ability of individuals with tetraplegia to use their hands. The purpose of this study is to investigate if ""random noise"", a special type of brain stimulation that most people cannot feel, can be used to enhance upper limb function in individuals with spinal cord injury.

NCT02441985,rTMS Therapy for Primary Orthostatic Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02441985,,COMPLETED,"Primary orthostatic tremor(POT) is a rare progressive functionally disabling tremor disorder. The characteristic features of POT are symptoms of unsteadiness in legs reported by patients when they are standing and improvement of symptoms upon walking and sitting. Due to the limited success of other treatment options there is a clear merit in continuing efforts to explore and investigate novel treatment modalities. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established physiological tool to understand brain function. When repetitious TMS pulses are delivered to a specific target at predefined stimulation parameters, it is referred to as rTMS therapy.The investigators propose a novel approach to investigate the clinical and physiological effects of low frequency rTMS therapy in POT. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that low frequency rTMS therapy delivered to the cerebellum will modulate the cerebellar excitability and result in clinical improvements.In order to determine the physiological effects related to rTMS, the tremor physiology will also be recorded with surface electromyography (EMG). The investigator will also record the changes in cerebellum excitability in response to rTMS using cerebello-cortical inhibition (CBI), a well-established TMS parameter.",NO,Primary Orthostatic Tremor,"DEVICE: Magstim RapidStim2|DEVICE: Sham Magstim RapidStim2|OTHER: Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS)|OTHER: Timed ""Up & Go"" Test (TUG) test|OTHER: 10m walk test|OTHER: Tremor electrophysiology|OTHER: Cerebellar-brain Inhibition (CBI)","Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), Part A assesses examiner-reported tremor location/severity (amplitude), Part B assesses examiner-reported ability to perform specific motor tasks/functions (writing, drawing, and pouring with dominant and non-dominant hand), and Part C assesses patient-reported functional disability resulting from the tremor (speaking, eating, drinking, hygiene, dressing, writing, working, and social activities).All tremor items will be rated based on a scale of 0=none to 4=severe. Finally, the TRS includes one separate item dealing with global assessment of tremor-related disability, rated both by patient and examiner on a 5-point scale.
