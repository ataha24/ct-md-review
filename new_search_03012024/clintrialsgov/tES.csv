It is a well-tolerated procedure that can be performed on an outpatient basis. It uses a plastic covered coil that sends a magnetic pulse through the skull into the brain and by targeting particular areas in the brain it can be used to help modulate the perception of pain.

The study intends to use this technique to treat such a disabling symptom in patients who suffer from Parkinson's Disease (PD). Initially the aim is to study this technique in ten patients who are suffering from pain and have PD. These patients would initially require an MRI scan which allows us to map the brain and target the correct brain areas for the delivery of the stimulation. The stimulation would be performed over ten sessions and the patients would be assessed by a clinician using well recognized clinical tools.

It is anticipated that there will be a meaningful improvement in pain. It is also anticipated that TMS is a safe technique to use in patients with PD.

NCT05198921,The Effectiveness of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05198921,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain.

Nowadays, CP is not fully curable, and physiotherapy should be used in conjunction with other interventions such as oral drugs, botulinum toxin type A, continuous pump-administered intrathecal baclofen, orthopaedic surgery and selective dorsal rhizotomy. However, several systematic reviews conclude that there is low evidence that these invasive therapies are more effective than placebo.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a type of neuromodulatory technique through magnetic impulses. The effect of rTMS depends on the frequency of the emitted electromagnetic field; low frequencies (‚â§1 Hz) lead to an inhibition of neuronal electrical activity at the stimulation site, while high frequencies (‚â•3 Hz) cause neuronal depolarization.

The objective of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) protocol, as an adjunct treatment to neurorehabilitation to improve gross motor function and quality of life in school-age children with spastic diplegia-type infantile cerebral palsy.",NO,"Cerebral Palsy, Spastic",DEVICE: repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation|DEVICE: sham repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,"Change in Gross Motor Function by the Gross Motor Function-66, The GMFM is a standardized assessment instrument designed to measure change over time in gross motor function in cerebral palsy children. The GMFS-66 is an 66-item measure with five dimensions: lying and rolling, crawling/kneeling, standing and walking/running/jumping. Each GMFM item is graded on a 4-point scale. The magnitude of change that is considered clinically important for an individual child will vary and depend on the judgments made by the child, family, and therapist. It takes between 20-25 minutes to be completed. GMFM presents good longitudinal construct validity, the test - retest is high with a 0.99 ICC and researchers indicate that GMFM adequately measure change over time in gross motor function for children with CP., baseline, one month, two months, three months and six months.","Change in Functional Strength by the Functional Strength Measure, The functional strength measurement (FSM) measures functional strength in both, upper and lower extremities. It consists of eight items matching activities of children in aged group from 4 to 10 years with typically developing (TD). The FSM has been adapted for children with CP (FSM-CP). The test-retest reliability of FSM-CP, has shown to be high and the comparison of the scores on the FSM-CP with the HHD showed mostly moderate correlations. In the present study, only the items related to lower extremities will be evaluated. Participants will have the opportunity to practice every test item maximum five trials before being tested. Each item will be examined three times and the highest score will be the useful for the analysis. To be able to say that a child improved after a treatment, needs to improve his/her score from the last examination., baseline, one month, two months, three months and six months.|Change in Quality of Life by the Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life-Child, The CP QOL-Child is questionnaire designed to assess the QOL in children aged between 4-12 years. It is composed by two parts. The first one a caregiver/parent report for children aged 4 to 12 years and the second one is a self-report of children aged from 9 to 12 years. The parent-proxy version comprises 65 items, and the child self-report version comprises 53 items. The CP QOL-Child measures the seven areas of child's life such as; social wellbeing and acceptance, participation and physical health, feelings about functioning, emotional wellbeing and self-esteem, pain and impact of disability, access to services, and family health. For each question there's a number 1 (very unhappy) to 9 (very happy) (46). The scoring involves two steps. At the first step the items are transformed to a scale with a possible range of 0-100 and the second step it is done by the algebraic mean of item values for each domain. The scoring process is explained on the CP QOL-Child manual 2nd version., baseline, one month, two months, three months and six months.|Change in Spasticity by the Modified-Modified Ashworth Scale., The scale most commonly used to evaluate spasticity is the Ashworth scale (AS) and the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The ICC scores of interrater reliability ranged from 0.54 to 0.80 and the intrarater reliability from 0.31 to 0.82. MAS is the primary outcome measure but at the time of data analysis the grades are modified (m-MAS), Modified-Modified Ashworth Scale. Therefore, the Rehabilitation Measures Database, suggests that a one-point change on the MAS reflects a clinically significant improvement. The score is based on the resistance felt during that one second of passive movement and it should be done 1-3 times at most. The target muscles will be hip flexors, adductors and tibialis anterior in both lower extremities.

NCT04762823,Multiple Sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in People With Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04762823,,WITHDRAWN,"Parkinson's disease (PD) affects approximately 1 million people in the US, with annual health care costs approaching $11 billion. PD results from a loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. This decrease in dopamine is associated with shaking, stiffness, slowness, balance/walking problems, thinking, and fatigue which severely impair activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective therapies would have significant benefits.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can influence how the brain works. A review of studies concluded that, overall, tDCS improves walking and balance in people with PD (PwPD). However, these studies had mixed results. For example, most have stimulated the frontal brain areas and all have used intensities of 2 mA (milliamperes; a measure of electrical current strength) or less. However, given the vital role of the cerebellum in walking and balance, and in PD impairments, the cerebellum may represent a more effective brain target. A recent review of studies also recommended performing investigations of higher intensity tDCS (greater than 2 mA), to potentially increase stimulation efficacy. No study has investigated the effects of multiple sessions of cerebellar tDCS on gait and balance in PwPD and none have used tDCS intensities greater than 2 mA. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine if repeated sessions of cerebellar tDCS might improve walking and balance in the short- and long-term.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Healthy Adult,DEVICE: Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation at 4 mA|DEVICE: Sham cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation,"Movement Disorder Society version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPRDS), The scale includes four parts that assess activities of daily living (Parts I and II), a motor exam (Part III), and medication-related motor complications (Part IV).

It is mostly characterized by the presence of motor difficulties. However, it can also be accompanied by cognitive disorders which have an equally significant impact on the quality of life of patients and which are not relieved by any treatment.

Among the functions affected by Parkinson's disease, inhibition is an essential process for adapting our behaviors in daily life. Inhibition allows us to stop an action that is no longer required or appropriate to the situation in which we find ourselves in. For example, it comes into play when we have to stop at a ""stop"" sign while driving.

Recent studies suggest that it could be possible to improve the functioning of these processes by using non-invasive brain stimulation tools. Transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation has thus showed promising results in improving functions such as working memory. This technique is completely painless and non-invasive and consists in applying an electric current of very low intensity (barely perceptible) at the level of the scalp, using electrodes.

The investigators are conducting a study to test whether transcranial alternating current electrical stimulation could improve the functioning of the inhibition process which is altered in patients. For this, the investigators will measure this process using a task performed on a computer (the Stop Signal Reaction Time Task), as well as brain activity using a method called ""electroencephalography"", before and after stimulation.

In healthy subjects, the investigator's team has also demonstrated that transcranial direct current ""cathodal"" electrical stimulation (tDCS) of Supplementary Motor Areas decreases the frequency of behavioral errors by improving the ability to ""correct"" responses.

The main objective of this project is to determine whether cathodal tDCS of Supplementary Motor Areas in PD patients under dopaminergic treatment improves the control and correction of errors about to be made and compensates for the deficits induced by the treatment.

All participants will perform a reaction time task of choice (Simon's task), with and without (""sham"" session) tDCS.

NCT04046055,Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04046055,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects approximately 1 million people in the United States with total annual costs approaching 11 billion dollars. The most common symptoms of PD are tremor, stiffness, slowness, and trouble with balance/walking, which lead to severe impairments in performing activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective add-ons to current therapeutic treatment approaches would have many benefits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can affect brain activity and can help make long-term brain changes to improve functions like walking and balance. While a few initial research studies and review articles involving tDCS have concluded that tDCS may improve PD walking and balance, many results are not meaningful in real life and several crucial issues still prevent tDCS from being a useful add-on intervention in PD. These include the selection of stimulation sites (brain regions stimulated) and tDCS electrode placement. Most studies have targeted the motor cortex (brain region that controls intentional movement), but there is evidence that the cerebellum - which helps control gait and balance, is connected to several other brain areas, and is easily stimulated with tDCS - may be a likely location to further optimize walking and balance in PD. There is also evidence that certain electrodes placements may be better than others. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of cerebellar tDCS stimulation using two different placement strategies on walking and balance in PD.

Additionally, although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities (for example, 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently used in most tDCS research are less than 2 mA, which is sufficient to produce measurable improvements; but, these improvements may be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate stimulation approaches were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities (for example, up to 4 mA) have been performed in different people and were found to have no additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established, studies exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e., 2 mA) and higher (i.e., 4 mA) intensities are necessary to determine if increasing the intensity increases the effectiveness of the desired outcome.

Prospective participants will include 10 people with mild-moderate PD that will be recruited to complete five randomly-ordered stimulation sessions, separated by at least 5 days each.

In dystonia, muscle spasms cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Focal dystonia involves just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or face. When people with focal hand dystonia make small and repeated movements with their hands, there is extra activity in the part of the brain called the motor cortex. TEP is a method of brain stimulation that slows down the activity of the nerve cells in the motor cortex. This study may help researchers develop new ways to treat focal hand dystonia.

People 18 years of age and older with focal hand dystonia may be eligible for this study. Participants have a neurological examination and are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: TEP or placebo stimulation. The TEP group receives stimulation to the parts of the brain used for hand movement, and the placebo group receives sham stimulation, which does not affect any area of the brain. There are three TEP/placebo sessions over a period of 7 to 10 days. The first session may last up to 2-1/2 hours; the other two sessions last 1-2 hours.

For TEP, sponge electrodes are placed on the scalp and an electrical current is passed through the scalp and skull to the outer part of brain. Before and after each session, participants have a neurological examination, including an evaluation of the rate and severity of their movement problems. For this assessment, participants do a writing test while the electrical activity of their hand muscles is recorded using surface electromyography (EMG).

Normally, when a person moves a finger, the brain's motor cortex prevents the other fingers from moving involuntarily.

For the TMS procedure, subjects are seated in a comfortable chair with their hands placed on a pillow on their lap. An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the brain that controls movement, or it may induce twitches or transient tingling in the forearm, head or face muscles. Subjects will be asked to move a finger. Just before this movement, a brief electrical stimulation will be applied to the end of either the second or fifth finger.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disease of the nervous system that affects movement, produced by the destruction of dopaminergic neurons found in a region of the brain called the basal ganglia Over time, different strategies have been developed to treat and slow the progress of the disease, including pharmacological, rehabilitative and even surgical treatments.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that delivers a low-intensity electrical current to the scalp, usually between 1 and 2 mA over approximately 5 to 30 minutes. The tDCS technique is used with the aim of enhancing a specific brain activity through the neuromodulation of neuronal excitability. In pathologies such as PD, these therapies have been shown to induce immediate after-effects in the brain that translate into reduced gait freezing and improvements in executive function and mobility. In addition, the combined effects of tDCS and physical therapy on the walking ability of PD patients have been studied, where it was shown that anodic tDCS and physiotherapy could be used as a combination treatment to improve patients' gait speed.

Another potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of PD consists of the use of sound stimulation with beat frequencies similar to the step. Specifically, this technology is characterized by presenting two tones of different frequencies for each ear in order to influence the mood and mental performance of the listener.

A stroke with involvement of motor function leads to a reduced excitability in affected hemisphere M1 and to an increased excitability of contralateral M1.

Patients mainly present with imbalance during walking, speech problem and difficulty in co-ordination during working with hands. No effective treatment is currently available for them. Currently, studies are going on the effectiveness of noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) in neurodegenerative diseases. It is a mode of brain stimulation technique where current is delivered into the brain by placing electrodes into their scalp. Transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) is a new modality of NIBS. . The clinical benefit observed after a single session of tPCS in 15 patients with neurodegenerative ataxia, suggest that prolonged stimulation could be even more effective. The investigator have planned to study the efficacy of long-term tPCS in these patients of neurodegenerative ataxia.

Patients will be first examined clinically by the researcher along with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and Cerebellar Cognitive Affective Syndrome Scale (CCAS). Upper limb motor function, speech and Gait will be assessed according to the established protocol.

After the screening visit and inclusion, all patients will be randomized into daily cerebello- spinal tPCS or sham stimulation.

Anodal stimulation will be used for cerebellum and cathodal stimulation for the spinal stimulation. 20 min of non-invasive stimulation will be given via tPCS either real or sham stimulation.

CSP duration will be determined as the period between the onset of MEP and the return of baseline EMG activity measured 50 ms before the TMS stimulus., Baseline, 1 day post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention|Gradient of the Recruitment Curve ( Also Known as Stimulus-response Curve), TMS stimuli will be applied at 10% steps between 100% to 160% RMT. 10 stimuli will be delivered at each intensity. Peak to peak amplitude of 10 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) at each stimulus intensity will be averaged offline.The cut-off intensity is set at 75% of maximum stimulator output due to discomfort perceived by majority of the participants. MEPs will be normalised with the maximal muscle action potential (MMax), which is determined by supramaximal electrical stimulation of the fibular nerve. A scatter graph will be generated with the average amplitude of MEPs as a function of stimulation intensity. The linear trend will be added to generate the linear recruitment curve slope., Baseline, 1 day post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention|Short-interval-intracortical Inhibition, Short-interval-intracortical inhibition (SICI) is another measure of cortical inhibition. In a paired- pulse TMS paradigm, a test pulse will be adjusted to produce MEP of at least 0.5 millivolts which will be delivered preceded by a brief conditioned pulse set at a lower intensity of 80% RMT with inter-stimulus interval of 2 milliseconds. Two stimulators connected via a Bistim module ( Magstim Co.,Whitland, UK) will be used in this test. Ten conditioned MEPs and unconditioned MEPs will be obtained in a random order and were averaged for each condition. SICI is expressed as percentage of unconditioned test MEP amplitude., Baseline, 1 day post-intervention, 1 month post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention",The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,51,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",HSEARS20140423002,2016-10,2018-12,2019-05,2016-03-08,2019-02-21,2019-11-22,"Rehabilitation Sciences, Hong Kong, 852, Hong Kong","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://storage.googleapis.com/ctgov2-large-docs/47/NCT02701647/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
