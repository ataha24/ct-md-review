This pressure test is associated with some adverse effects including inflammation of the pancreas gland. We are investigating an alternative test in which medication is given to provoke spasm of the sphincter.

NCT03049033,NMT for Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03049033,,RECRUITING,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is defined by characteristic motor symptoms including slow movements, small movements, difficulty with movement initiation and disruptions in timing. Besides gross motor symptoms, fine motor impairments in PD cause difficulties with everyday tasks such as writing, self-care, and fine object manipulation. These activity limitations can lead to disability, social isolation, and a reduced quality of life. In a series of breakthrough studies Michael Thaut and colleagues developed Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) and found it can address many gross motor impairments and improve gait and balance. Other music therapies such as Music-supported Therapy (MST) have proven motor benefits in stroke patients through movement exercises with musical instruments. However, the pathological basal ganglia (BG) in PD brains leads to a reduced supply of those internally generated movements. In contrast, externally cued movements (eg. via a beat or a rhythm) during NMT sessions are instantaneously entrained to the period of a rhythmic stimulus possibly without involvement of the BG. The underlying idea is that rhythm is the essential component relating music specifically to motor behavior. The mechanism of action is called ""rhythmic entrainment"" where one system's motion or signal frequency entrains the frequency of another system. The effect of NMT on fine motor function has not been investigated yet. Music activities are important in the lives of many older adults. Notably, the use of music has been associated with increased well-being for older adults, as it fosters social connection and mood regulation. Furthermore, many musical activities have limited physical demands, making them attainable for individuals who are living with mobility impairments or other physical restrictions. Based on the literature and the investigators preliminary studies, the investigators propose to test the efficacy of Neurologic Music Therapy in comparison to Music Supported Therapy and Occupational Therapy (OT) as standard of care on adults in the Parkinson's spectrum.

NCT00955877,Extended-release Epidural Morphine for Acute Post-operative Analgesia Following Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy in Children,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00955877,,TERMINATED,"The purpose of this proposal is to improve the investigators' current Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) analgesia protocol by eliminating or minimizing the use of fentanyl in the post-operative period.

Children undergoing SDR for spastic cerebral palsy have significant post-operative pain. The procedure requires dissection of the lumbar back musculature and removal of the L1 lamina (the bony posterior part of the vertebra). The majority of the operation is intradural, and a water-tight dural closure at the termination of the operation is critical in order to prevent leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the wound. In fact, these children must remain flat on their back for 48 hours to allow the dural incision to heal prior to mobilization. Thus, adequate pain control is essential not only for patient comfort, but also to prevent agitation and additional stress on the dural closure.

Currently, the investigators' patients undergoing SDR are treated for 48 hours with scheduled intravenous (IV) narcotic (continuous fentanyl infusion at 0.5-2.0 μg/kg/hour) in addition to the sedative/muscle relaxant Valium (0.2 mg/kg IV every 4 hours for 24 hours, then every 6 hours for 24 hours). The IV fentanyl, and to a lesser degree Valium, carries a real risk of hypotension and respiratory depression and requires frequent dose adjustments to achieve adequate analgesia.
