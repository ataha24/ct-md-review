NCT03189472,Remotely-supervised Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for At-home Treatment of Fatigue and Cognitive Slowing in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03189472,,COMPLETED,"This is a double-blind randomized controlled pilot study to test the effects of Remotely-Supervised (RS)-tDCS using a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex montage to ameliorate fatigue and cognitive slowing in PD.

Fatigue and slowed thinking are very prevalent symptoms in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date there are no concrete effective treatment available for either symptom. This study will test transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to ameliorate fatigue and slowed thinking in PD. tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that is low-cost, relatively safe, and reproducible when conducted in repeat clinic visits.

Following procedures for our validated protocol, participants will receive training on the use of study tDCS device and pre configured laptop computer. The device will be programmed to deliver either active or sham tDCS (all study personnel and participants will be blinded), and operated with unlock codes provided by the study technician daily to release one session. Once trained, and following an initial in-clinic baseline tDCS tolerability test and initial treatment session, participants will use the equipment to complete the remaining sessions from their home using our tele medicine platform. Remote supervision will be provided using HIPAA secure online video conference with the study technician following clearly-defined operational procedures. Participants will be monitored to determine if any predefined ""stop"" criteria are met using VSee software, a telemedicine software. Additionally, Team Viewer software will allow study technicians to troubleshoot any computer issues, to initiate the video conference on behalf of participants, and to remotely supervise the entire tDCS session.",NO,Parkinson Disease,DEVICE: Active tDCS|DEVICE: Sham tDCS,"Number of participants having completed 80% sessions, 5 Weeks",,,NYU Langone Health,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,31,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",17-00486,2017-11-01,2020-05-01,2020-05-01,2017-06-16,,2020-08-21,"New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York, 10016, United States",

However, treatment of these dysfunctions is in its infancy.

The purpose of this study is 1) to assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial using an online computerized intervention for training cognitive abilities in the three patient groups and 2) to estimate the effect of the online training on objectively and subjectively measured cognitive functions.

NCT01856010,Study of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Treatment for Agitation and Aggression in Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01856010,,COMPLETED,"Agitation/aggression is one of the most common and serious behavioral complications of dementia. If the behavior is refractory to standard care (behavior approaches and off label use of psychotropic medications), other evidence based treatment options are not currently available. Retrospective reviews and preliminary studies have indicated Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) may be a safe, effective intervention in this patient population. This study will measure the impact of open-label ECT on symptoms of agitation, aggression, cognition, mood and psychosis for patients referred for ECT who accept this intervention vs. those patients referred for ECT but decline this intervention (i.e. standard care controls). It will also assess adverse events, activities of daily living and caregiver burden during study participation. The hypothesis is that subjects with dementia related aggression/agitation who receive ECT will show significantly greater reductions in these behaviors than subjects who do not consent for ECT and continue with standard care. Pine Rest is partnering with McLean Hospital (Massachusetts) to answer this question. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine whether patients receiving ECT or standard care differ in reduction of aggression and agitation symptom severity and changes in cognition pre- and post- treatment.",NO,Dementia|Aggression|Agitation,OTHER: ECT treatment|OTHER: Standard Care (Non-ECT group),"Change in baseline of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Short Version (CMAI), Measures agitation or aggression outcomes - completed by primary caregiver, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks","Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), Gathers direct performance-based data from the subject with dementia on a wide variety of low-level tasks that take into account the specific behavioral and cognitive deficits associated with severe dementia, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms - completed by primary caregiver, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home Version (NPI), Measures neuropsychiatric symptoms outcomes and caregiver burden - completed by primary caregiver, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Clinical Global Impression Scale: Severity (CGI-S), Indicates severity of dementia with agitation/aggression at the time of assessment - completed by physician, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Measures cognition - primary caregiver completes with subject, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 4th Edition (WAIS-IV) Digit Span (forwards and backwards), Measures concentration, attention and memory - primary caregiver completes with subject, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Geriatric Evaluation of Mental Status (GEMS), Measures list learning tasks to assess verbal memory outcome - primary caregiver completes with subject, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Measures functional ability outcomes - completed by primary caregiver, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Use of Psychoactive ""As Needed"" (PRN) Medication, Records use of PRN medication for agitation/aggression, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks|Delirium and/or adverse reactions to ECT or medication, Assessed by treating physician, Participants will be followed on the average of 5 weeks (+/- 1 week) since ECT treatment is generally administered 3x per week for 4 weeks",,Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services,Mclean Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,23,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,SM10-1221-01,2011-03,2012-10,2012-10,2013-05-17,,2015-02-16,"McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts, 02478, United States|Older Adult Unit of Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 49548, United States",
