The surgical implantation of the leads will be based on standard of care and will be completed with FDA-approved leads that are routinely used at Cleveland Clinic. The pulse generators (i.e. the battery) will also be standard. The research will characterize spontaneous and task-related changes in brain activity recorded from these regions alone and in relation to novel paradigms / settings of stimulation to learn how such paradigms impact both the symptoms of patients with Parkinson's disease and the underlying neural activity of the target brain region. Of particular interest is to learn if the novel paradigms of stimulation will have a lower impact on cognitive function than current settings of stimulation.To date, current DBS settings are continuous. That is, stimulation runs at approximately 200 pulses per second, all day long, day and night.

The novel settings that investigators will study are part of a translational pipeline at Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Ken Baker and Dr. Machado are partners in the lab and in clinical research. Dr. Baker has completed preclinical research that has shown that it is possible to achieve excellent relief of parkinsonian symptoms with intermittent types of stimulation known as coordinated reset. In other words, Dr Baker found that using a lower dose of stimulation in an intermittent fashion can maintain the same level of symptom control. Furthermore, a lower dose of stimulation could have less effects on cognitive symptoms.

In order to test these novel paradigms of stimulation, investigators will study patients immediately after DBS and over time. The immediate research will be done starting on the third day after implantation of the DBS lead(s), having the systems externalized for nine days.

These symptoms are less or unresponsive to levodopa treatment and are considered to be a contraindication for deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. Falls and freezing of gait are responsible for high morbidity (fractures, residential health care) and increased significantly mortality. The pathophysiology of gait and balance disorders is still poorly understood, but recent data obtained in animals and humans suggest that a degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), within the mesencephalic locomotor region, could play a crucial role. In line with this hypothesis, low-frequency stimulation of the pedunculopontine area, thought to increase the activity of the remaining cholinergic PPN neurons, has been proposed to alleviate gait and balance disorders in advanced PD patients.

NCT01590056,Emotional and Cognitive Subthalamic Nucleus in Deep Brain Stimulation Treated Parkinson Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01590056,,UNKNOWN,"About 300 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been successfully treated by deep brain stimulation (DBS) during the last 10 years in Hadassah. In most of the patients the site of stimulation is the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Recent studies by our group and others have demonstrated that the STN is divided into motor and non-motor areas. The investigators have recently shown that electrophysiological mapping of the STN during the surgery can differentiate motor and non-motor areas of the STN. Existing methods of adjustment of DBS parameters aim at amelioration of the motor signs and therefore with inactivation of the STN motor territory only. Although the DBS parameter setting is believed to influence the mental and cognitive states, there is no data that correlates stimulation parameters with mental and cognitive state. In addition, DBS parameter setting is also believed to influence important verbal functions which are partially related to motor, mental and cognitive states, but no data correlates the verbal function with the DBS stimulation parameters.

The investigators hypothesize that the cognitive areas of the STN have distinct electrophysiological properties similar to our findings with the limbic / mental areas of the STN. The investigators further hypothesize that specific stimulation of these cognitive areas can influence the cognitive state and thus treatment with cognitive-adjusted DBS can improve the cognitive symptoms of PD.

In this project, the investigators intend to map the motor, emotional and cognitive areas of the STN using neuronal (single units) responses to emotional voices and cognitive tasks and to identify the emotional and cognitive spectral signature of the STN single unit activity using spectral analysis and neuronal responses to emotional voices and cognitive tasks. In addition the investigators intend to find the neuronal signature of speech and to find the correlation between motor, mental and limbic electrophysiology to speech. The investigators also intend to investigate the motor, emotional and cognitive processing of PD patients by manipulating the stimulation of the STN.

NCT05314322,Deep Brain Stimulation on Dual-task Gait Performance in PD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05314322,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Motor symptoms include rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, and postural instability, these motor symptoms can cause gait dysfunction. Non-motor symptoms include depression, dysarthria, cognitive disability, and sleep disturbance. Although these symptoms can be improved through drug treatment, when the course of PD reaches the middle to late stage, it will still face the situation of weakened drug efficacy and the drug side effects increased. When medication can no longer adequately control the motor symptoms of PD, deep brain stimulation (DBS) becomes a powerful option. DBS is a surgical treatment that involves implanting one or more electrodes into specific areas of the brain, which deliver electrical stimulation to regulate or destroy abnormal neural signal patterns in the target area. The effect of DBS has been proven whether it is in improving motor-related symptoms or non-motor-related symptoms, but there are still some areas that have not been compared before and after the surgery, such as: gait variability, executive functions and dual-task walking. In addition, the parameters of electrical stimulation for DBS will also affect the clinical characteristics of patients.

Studies have shown that traditional medical and rehabilitation treatments are not good for improving patients' motor function, deep brain stimulation (DBS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can improve the motor function of patients, but there is no comparative study between them. Objectives: This study compares the efficacy and safety of DBS and VNS in the recovery of motor function in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, determining the best treatment for patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, and providing high-level clinical evidence for patients and clinicians to choose from. Methods/Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-controlled pilot study. A total of 98 patients with post-stroke hemiplegia are assigned to receive DBS or VNS. After 3 and 6 months of follow-up, all the devices are turned off. After a 2-week washout, the control group is turned on, but the stimulation group is given sham stimulation. After 9 and 12 months of follow-up, all the devices are turned on. Then, at postoperative 15 and 18 months, postoperative neuroimaging and various post-stroke motor-related scores were performed for data collection and analysis. Discussion: We propose a study design and rationale to compare the efficacy and safety of DBS and VNS in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia to provide evidence and reference for implantable neuromodulation in the treatment of post-stroke dysfunction, and to compare the therapeutic effects of DBS and VNS to provide evidence for patient and clinical diagnosis and treatment choices.

NCT01135407,Visual Selective Attention in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01135407,VSA-PD,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD), which is generally considered to be a motor disorder, is now known to be accompanied in many instances by a variety of cognitive defects. This can be explained considering that PD is a neurodegenerative and progressive disorder of the basal ganglia system, which works modulating not only motor, but also cognitive and emotional behaviours.

Concerning this, some studies suggest that non-demented PD patients may suffer from a voluntary selective visual attention orienting deficit, showing a reduced skill in focusing upon one target, and may be easily distracted from irrelevant but salient stimuli, with a consequent negative impact on their physical health, social interactions and quality of life.

Up to now, the evidence of the role of the basal-ganglia system in modulating visual attention functions is poor and indirect and the effects of dopaminergic and subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation (two usual and effective treatments in PD) on attention performances are controversial.

The main objectives of the project are: 1) to assess the visual selective attention as well as the distractibility in PD patients; 2) to study the effects of patient's usual antiparkinsonian treatments, that is dopaminergic and STN stimulation, on visual attention performances.

Secondly, from a clinical and neurophysiologic point of view, the investigators want to study the respective role of the dopaminergic pathways and the sensorimotor and associative/limbic cortico-basal ganglia loops passing across the STN in the visual attention performances.

To precisely answer the objectives of the protocol, the investigators will record the performances of participants during the administration of 3 computerized tests, which are suitable to study visual attention, decision making and motor performances.

The investigators will compare the performances on the computerized tests of two groups of PD patients, one evaluated in different sets of electrical (without stimulation, or selective stimulation of the sensorimotor or associative/limbic part of the STN) stimulation, the other in different conditions of medication (with or without dopaminergic treatment) with those of a group of healthy subjects.",NO,Visual Attention in Parkinson's Disease,OTHER: Recording during computerized tests|OTHER: Recording during computerized tests|OTHER: Recording during computerized tests,"reaction time in trials of the computerized tests, Reaction times is recorded during one hour sessions for each patient/control subject (for more details see the Intervention Section), 1 hour for each experimental session.

STN DBS improves dopaminergic drug-responsive motor symptoms, thus allowing a reduction of post-operative drug dose. However, a considerable variation in the extent of dopaminergic drug reduction has been reported, with values ranging from 20% to 100%. Both L-dopa and DAs can be used, however, there are no formal studies examining which type of antiparkinsonian medication may be more effective and/or better tolerated following STN DBS.

Aim of our study is to compare the efficacy and the tolerability of L-dopa monotherapy versus DAs monotherapy after STN DBS over a 3-month follow up period.

This study is a prospective, single blind parallel trial comparing L-dopa monotherapy and DAs monotherapy after STN DBS. Patients will be enrolled in pairs, with one patient randomly assigned to L-dopa monotherapy and the other to DA monotherapy after STN DBS (20 patients for each study arm). Treatment assignment will be unmasked for the patient but will be blinded for the neurologist programming DBS and evaluating the patient. Another neurologist will be in charge of medication adjustments. Primary outcome is the change in severity of non-motor symptoms as assessed by the Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) at 3-month follow up visit after surgery.

In spite of an improvement of the motor condition many patients develop apathy and depression following surgery (""Neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease: the doctor is happy, the patient less so""). This study will shed light on the best way to manage patients after STN procedure, thus contributing to a further improvement of the surgical outcome in a population of young and motivated patients (those commonly receiving STN DBS), eventually bringing them closer to a normal personal and social life.

Purpose: To evaluate benefits of STN-DBS on upper gastrointestinal symptoms and motility.

NCT04725045,Investigating the Use of Complex Pulse Shapes for DBS in Movement Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04725045,INSHAPE_DBS,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease and essential tremor are chronic movement disorders for which there is no cure. When medication is no longer effective, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recommended. Standard DBS is a neuromodulation method that uses a simple monophasic pulse, delivered from an electrode to stimulate neurons in a target brain area. This monophasic pulse spreads out from the electrode creating a broad, electric field that stimulates a large neural population. This can often effectively reduce motor symptoms. However, many DBS patients experience side effects - caused by stimulation of non-target neurons - and suboptimal symptom control - caused by inadequate stimulation of the correct neural target. The ability to carefully manipulate the stimulating electric field to target specific neural subpopulations could solve these problems and improve patient outcomes. The use of complex pulse shapes, specifically biphasic pulses and asymmetric pre-pulses, can control the temporal properties of the stimulation field. Evidence suggests that temporal manipulations of the stimulation field can exploit biophysical differences in neurons to target specific subpopulations. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of complex pulse shapes to reduce side effects and improve symptom control in DBS movement patients.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Essential Tremor,DEVICE: Boston Scientific: Study tool computer,"Stage 1: Therapeutic window = Amplitude at which therapeutic benefit is obtained versus amplitude at which side-effects occur, both expressed in mA (milliamperes)., Amplitude at which therapeutic benefit is obtained versus amplitude at which side-effects occur, both expressed in mA (milliamperes)., Immediately after testing|Stage 2 ET (3 hours): tremor scores, FTM (Fahn-Tolosa-Marin) total score.

NCT03078816,Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation for Secondary Dystonia in Children and Young Adults,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03078816,DBSVop,COMPLETED,"Dystonia is a movement disorder seen in both children and adults that is characterized by ""sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both."" Secondary dystonia is far more common in pediatric populations than primary dystonia, and far more recalcitrant to standard pharmacologic and surgical treatments including Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). There exists a large unmet need to develop new therapeutics, treatment strategies, and outcome measures for pediatric secondary dystonia.

The investigators are proposing to investigate the ventralis oralis posterior nucleus (Vop) of the thalamus as a new target for DBS in secondary dystonia. Prior to the development of DBS, the main surgical treatment of dystonia was thalamotomy. Although there were many different targets in the thalamus, often done in staged procedures, the most common and successful targeted nuclei was the Vop, which is traditionally thought to be the pallidal receiving area. Previous lesioning of Vop produced improvements in dystonia but intolerable side effects, especially when implanted bilaterally. However, given that secondary dystonia patients were often reported to have superior results to primary dystonia it is reasonable to believe that if the side effects can be modulated, that targeting of the Vop nucleus with DBS could be a viable alternative to Globus Pallidus interna (GPi). Given that Deep Brain Stimulation is a treatment that is inherently adjustable, it is conceivable that settings on the Deep Brain Stimulation could be adjusted to allow for clinical benefit with minimal side effects.

Despite its ubiquity, a clear and consistent picture of the brain circuits mediating consciousness and responsiveness has not emerged. Studies to date are limited by lack of direct recordings in human brain during medically induced anesthesia. Our overall hypothesis is that the current model of consciousness, originally proposed to model disorders and recovery of consciousness after brain injury, can be generalized to understand mechanisms of consciousness more broadly. This will be studied through three specific aims. The first is to evaluate the difference in anesthesia sensitivity in patients with and without underlying basal ganglia pathology. Second is to correlate changes in brain circuitry with induction and emergence from anesthesia. The third aim is to evaluate the effects of targeted deep brain stimulation on anesthesia induced loss and recovery of consciousness. This study focuses on experimentally studying these related brain circuits by taking advantage of pathological differences in movement disorder patient populations undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that is used as treatment for movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, and provides a mechanism to acquire brain activity recordings in subcortical structures.

NCT01845883,Perceptual Decision Making Under Conditions of Visual Uncertainty,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01845883,,UNKNOWN,"In this proposal the investigators have three Specific Aims using human patient populations as model systems; 1) identify a role for the Basal Ganglia (BG) in perceptual decision making; 2) determine whether the Basal Ganglia contribute to decision making under conditions of visual uncertainty; 3) determine whether the cerebellum plays a role in perceptual decision-making under conditions of visual uncertainty. The investigators designed experiments using healthy humans and humans with diseases known to affect the Basal Ganglia and the cerebellum, Parkinson's Disease, dystonia and non-dystonic cerebellar damage. With this approach the investigators will test the following hypotheses: 1) Patients with Parkinson's Disease and dystonia will have more difficulty than healthy controls making perceptual decisions when faced with sensory uncertainty; when sensory information is certain, patients will show improved decision-making but will still be impaired relative to healthy humans. Hypothesis 2: If ambiguous sensory information is aided by prior information, patients with Parkinson's Disease and dystonia will be unable to use the prior (bias/memory) information to inform their decisions. Hypothesis 3: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of Basal Ganglia structures will improve the ability of patients to use prior information to inform their decisions when faced with sensory uncertainty. Hypothesis 4: Both cholinergic and dopaminergic medical therapies will improve the ability of patients to use prior information to inform their decisions. Hypothesis 5: Patients with non-dystonic cerebellar damage will be similar to healthy controls in performance of a perceptual decision making task in conditions of visual uncertainty. The overarching framework of this application is that the same mechanisms (D1 striatal synaptic plasticity) that operate in reward learning play a role in learning and using stimulus priors in a perceptual decision-making task when faced with uncertainty. Because Parkinson's Disease and dystonia share deficits in striatal circuitry, the patient deficits on this task will be similar. Because non-dystonic cerebellar patients do not have dysfunction of striatal circuits, they will show no deficits in the ability to use stimulus priors to guide choices in uncertain conditions. In the event these patients do show deficits, this is will provide evidence for an unexplored role for the cerebellum in perceptual decision-making.",NO,Parkinson's Disease|Dystonia|Ataxia,PROCEDURE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS),"Choice performance - % correct responses out of total number of trials, data from each subject will be assessed at the end of each session to monitor and measure outcome measures., at the end of each testing session - 2 hours","Reaction Time to make a choice - measured in milliseconds, data from each subject will be assessed at the end of each session to monitor and measure outcome measures., at the end of each testing session - 2 hours",,"University of California, Los Angeles",The Dana Foundation,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,120,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,12-001589,2013-04,2015-12,2016-12,2013-05-03,,2015-12-18,"Neuroscience Research Building, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States",
NCT05348837,Naturalistic Sleep Assessed by Wearable Devices in Parkinson Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05348837,,RECRUITING,"The cardinal motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) include bradykinesia, rest tremor, and rigidity. Though non-motor features have been recognized for centuries, only recently has the prevalence and impact of non-motor symptoms become the focus of intense study. Disturbances of sleep are among the most common non-motor manifestations of PD; approximately two-thirds of PD patients experience sleep dysfunction of some kind. Given that sleep contributes to the regulation of many physiological processes, sleep disturbance has a significant impact on quality of life in PD, and places high strain on caregivers. Though numerous symptomatic therapies exist, the treatment of sleep disorders in PD is limited by a lack of adequately powered, randomized studies providing high quality evidence. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) is primarily used to treat PD motor symptoms and reduce the need for dopaminergic medications, several studies have shown that DBS provides benefit for non-motor symptoms, including sleep disturbance. Few studies have used an objective measure to assess the impact of DBS on sleep in PD, and none have done so by studying sleep in the home environment. Existing studies have largely been limited to a single night of sleep recording in a sleep lab. Furthermore, no studies have assessed sleep both on and off medication, before and after DBS implantation. This study will enroll patients undergoing evaluation for DBS implantation.

In one study, 25% of essential tremor patients were forced to change jobs or take early retirement because of tremor. Essential tremor is directly linked to progressive functional impairment, social embarrassment, and even depression. The tremor associated with essential tremor is typically slow, involves the hands (and sometimes the head and voice), worsens with intentional movements, and is insidiously progressive over many years. Deep brain stimulation has emerged as a highly effective treatment for intractable, debilitating essential tremor. However, since the intention tremor of essential tremor is typically intermittent, and commonly absent at rest, the currently available continuous deep brain stimulation may be delivering unnecessary current to the brain that increases undesirable side effects such as slurred speech and walking difficulty, and hastens the depletion of device batteries, necessitating more frequent surgical procedures to replace spent pulse generators.

NCT05444907,Deep Brain Stimulation-Induced Mania in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05444907,BPD_DBS,RECRUITING,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common and debilitating neurodegenerative disease. While medication can alleviate its symptoms, not all patients will adequately respond to medical therapy. For these cases, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to improve symptoms and quality of life. Nevertheless, this approach is, in some cases, associated with incapacitating neuropsychiatric side-effects, including mood disturbances, such as DBS-induced mania. While this condition has important functional short- and long-term consequences for quality of life and prognosis, its pathophysiology is still poorly understood. In this project the investigators propose to conduct a retrospective and naturalistic study in PD patients in whom DBS stimulation resulted in mania or mixed state episode, to clarify if specific sociodemographic and clinical predictors, namely stimulation parameters and target locations, might be associated to the occurrence of this neuropsychiatric adverse event. Additionally, the investigators aim to clarify if the occurrence of DBS-induced mania results from the impact of specific stimulation parameters and/or target locations in functional connectivity networks. To explore this question, the investigators will use different neuroimaging analysis methods termed lesion topography analysis and lesion network mapping, in order to compute maps of the stimulated regions topography and the functional networks that are associated with DBS-mania, respectively.

In this study, the investigators will test the safety and utility of a novel adapted device that can not only deliver stimulation to the brain but also record brain signals in a patient that is implanted with a deep brain stimulation system. The purpose of this Phase I study is to understand the safety of the device as well as the relationship between these electrical signals measured from deep within the brain and Parkinson's symptoms and how these signals can be used to guide a self-programmed system. The study will entail implanting this special device (Activa PC+S) in place of the standard generator (Activa PC) and to compare clinical symptoms, recorded brain signals, and stimulation patterns during a one year period after implantation.

Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that it has been controversial whether DBS-subthal amic nucleus (STN) has facilitated or impaired cognitive function in patients with PD. The etiology of the effect of DBS on the single cognitive domain, executive function, has yet to be clarified. Previous clinical studies in which DBS was performed in patients with PD have been performed under the Stroop effect. TMT (Trail Making Test A and B) cognitive tests and simultaneous acquisition of brain function data by electroencephalograph-functional near-infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) have yet to be reported.

The cognitive differences of PD patients were interpreted by the actual physiological state represented by the brain network feature indicators, for example, a high node entry degree means high information inflow in the brain area where the node is located, short feature path length means high efficiency of whole-brain information transfer in the patient, and large clustering coefficient means high degree of modularity in the brain area of the PD patient.

NCT01796483,EEG and Pharmacological Exploration of Executive Dysfunctions Induced by STN-DBS in PD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01796483,EEGDBSNAd,COMPLETED,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) remarkably improves motor functions in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). However, growing evidence suggests that STN-DBS also causes executive inhibitory deficits and impulsive behaviour (Jahanshahi et al 2000; Schroeder et al 2002; Hershey et al 2004; Thobois et al 2007; Frank et al 2007; Ballanger et al., 2009). Despite a widespread use, the mechanisms of action of STN-DBS are still unclear. Two reasons might explain this. 1) From a theoretical point of view, cognitive models of executive control mechanisms are incomplete. 2) From a methodological point of view, investigating cerebral activity during STN-DBS is very limited because most techniques are incompatible with locally implanted electrodes.

This project relies on a double opportunity to answer these questions offered by recent theoretical and methodological advances. First, investigations in healthy subjects (Jaffard et al 2007, 2008, Boulinguez et al 2009) revealed an essential function of inhibitory control, so far ignored, consisting in locking in advance movement triggering processes to prevent undesired automatic or anticipated responses to unattended stimuli. In other words, key processes of executive control may act tonically before stimulation occurs, calling brain imaging studies to look at proactive and not only reactive activations. Second, recent advances in EEG signal processing now allow suppressing from the electroencephalogram DBS-related artifacts (Allen et al. 2010), providing a tremendous opportunity to use a non-invasive technique with the high temporal resolution necessary to disentangle proactive from reactive brain activity. To our knowledge, up to date no study has been published using EEG with STN-DBS patients since Allen et al.'s paper. The first operational purpose of this project is to identify the anatomo-functional origin of STN-DBS-induced executive dysfunction using EEG recordings in classical stimulus-response tasks. Results expected from this first part of the project may help resolving other long-lasting issues. Indeed, reactivity as assessed by simple reaction time in non-implanted patients as well as impulsivity in STN-DBS patients are known to remain insensitive to dopaminergic medication. Since the proactive activity related to executive, inhibitory, control may be supported by the noradrenergic (NA) system, the second purpose of this project is to test the original hypothesis according to which NA plays a central role in both akinesia and STN-DBS side effects.",NO,Parkinson Disease,DEVICE: Clonidine (Catapressan)|DEVICE: Placebo 90 minutes before EEG,"comparision placebo vs Clonidine, The primary outcome the study was designed to compare placebo vs clonidine effects on STN-DBS modulations of proactive inhibitory control using commission error rate as an index of impulsivity and reaction time as an index of akinesia, Primary outcome data will be analyzed at the completion of the study, i.e. after the planned 18-month duration of data collection from patients and control subjects.","Localisation of the sources of activity, The secondary outcome the study was designed to localize the sources of activity using EEG predicted by the proactive model and accounting for reaction time in controls and non impulsive patients ON stimulation (placebo session), Secondary outcome data will be analyzed at the completion of the study, i.e. after the planned 18-month duration of data collection from patients and control subjects.","Identification of the neural bases of efficient Brain activity regulation, The secondary outcome the study was designed to identify the neural bases of efficient brain activity regulation by STN-DBS in non impulsive PD patients (ON vs OFF comparison - placebo session), this outcome measure will be analyzed at the completion of the study, i.e. after the planned 18-month duration of data collection from patients and control subjects.|Identification of source showing abnormal activity, The secondary outcome the study was designed to detect among the sources revealed above those which show abnormal activity in impulsive PD patients ON stimulation, this outcome mesaure will be analyzed at the completion of the study, i.e. after the planned 18-month duration of data collection from patients and control subjects.|Identification of the source modulated by Clonidine, the study was designed to detect among the sources revealed above which ones are modulated by the pharmacological manipulation (Placebo vs Clonidine), this outcome mesaure will be analyzed at the completion of the study, i.e. after the planned 18-month duration of data collection from patients and control subjects.",Hospices Civils de Lyon,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,37,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",2012.712,2012-10,2013-06,2016-06,2013-02-21,,2019-05-28,"Hospices Civils de Lyon Hôpital Pierre Wertheimer, Bron, 69677, France",

Stimulating these areas can help block nerve signals that cause abnormal movements.

Objectives:

To test DBS as treatment for FHD. To learn about brain and nerve cell function in people with dystonia.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older with severe FHD who have tried botulinum toxin treatment at least twice

Design:

Participation lasts 5 years.

Participants will be screened with:

Medical history

Physical exam

Videotape of their dystonia

Blood, urine, and heart tests

Brain MRI scan

Chest X-ray

Neuropsychological tests: answering questions, doing simple actions, and taking memory and thinking tests.

Hand movement tests

Participants will have surgery: A frame fixes their head to the operating table. A small hole is made in the skull. Wires are inserted to record brain activity and stimulate the brain while they do simple tasks. The wires are removed and the DBS electrode is inserted into the hole. The neurostimulator is placed under the skin of the chest, with wires running to the electrode in the brain. They will have CT and MRI scans during surgery.

Participants will recover in the hospital for about 1 week.

The neurostimulator will be turned on 1 4 weeks after discharge. Participants will have regular visits until the study ends. Visits include:

Checking symptoms and side effects

MRI

Movement, thinking, and memory tests

If the neurostimulator s battery runs out, participants will have surgery to replace it.

TMS is a non-invasive procedure during which you sit in a chair that looks like one you would find at the dentist's office. A nerve stimulator is placed on the wrist of the right hand to stimulate the median nerve; the intensity of the nerve stimulator is gradually increased until the right thumb begins to twitch. A magnetic coil is placed on the scalp on one side of the head, overlying the brain's motor cortex, to stimulate the brain's output to the muscles in the opposite hand.

Instead, Parkinsons's disease seems accompanied by an increase in motor cortical activity.

A reaction time task, known as the ""Simon task"" in the literature, allows one to study the influence of irrelevant visual information on decision making. In the most common version of this task (used in the prosed study), the subjects have to choose between a left- and a right-hand keypress according to the color of a visual signal presented either to the left or to the right of a fixation. The to be established association is said ""congruent"" when the response is ipsilateral to the stimulus and ""incongruent"" when the response is contralateral to the stimulus. In healthy volunteers, EMG investigations have revealed that in a significant numbers of trials, the contraction of the response agonist is preceded by a infra-liminal contraction of the agonist involved in the non-required response. Such ""partial errors"" demonstrate that the nervous system is able to detect, abort and correct a part of its errors, thereby revealing the existence of an on-line executive control in simple decision tasks.

The ability of the RC+S to record Local Field Potentials (LFP's) is novel in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) technology. The primary goals of this project are to use this function of the RC+S to characterize:

1. The state- and target-dependency of neuronal oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), internal globus pallidus (GPi) or external globus pallidus (GPe) of patients with PD,
2. How these oscillations are altered by levodopa,
3. The effects of unilateral standard clinical isochronal (e.g. 140 Hz) GPi-, GPe-, and STN-DBS on oscillatory activity and its relationship to the presence and severity of parkinsonian motor signs.

These experiments will leverage the capacity to record LFPs from macroelectrodes implanted in either the GPi/GPe or STN using the Medtronic RC+S DBS system. The long-term goal for this project is to develop closed-loop methods for DBS that are state (resting vs. movement) and movement-phase appropriate.

Secondary objectives.

In addition to establishing the relationship between neural oscillations in the STN, GPi and GPe to clinical and quantitative measures of akinesia, bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity, this project will also examine the relationship of neural oscillations to:

These two targets are called the VIM nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) and the posterior subthalamic area (PSA), which includes the Zona Incerta. Both targets can be reached by one lead (wirh four electrode contact).

Patients that are found eligible for DBS because of severe action tremor of the arms are invited to participate. After randomization, half of them are stimulated first in the VIM for 3 months and then in the PSA for 3 months, and the other half first in the PSA and then VIM for 3 months each. Tremor severity is scored on a clinical quantitative scale at baseline and at the end of each of these two 3-month periods, and eventual side-effects are registered. The best target is then selected and after another 6 months scoring is repeated. We intend to provide robust data about whether one of the two targets is superior to the other both regarding ability to reduce tremor efficiently and to avoid or minimize side-effects, or if there is no significant difference between the two targets.

However, individual improvement after DBS remains variable and 20% of patients experience side effects. To date, DBS-electrode placement and settings in the highly connected thalamus are based on 1,5-Tesla or 3-Tesla MR-images. These low resolution and solely structural modalities are unable to visualize the multiple brain networks to this small nucleus and prevent electrode activation directed at its cortical projections. By using structural 7-Tesla MRI (7T MRI) connectivity to visualize (malfunctioning) brain networks, DBS-electrode placement and activation can be individualized.

Objective: Primary objective of the study is to determine whether visualisation of cortical projections originating in the thalamus and the position of the DBS electrode relative to these projections using 7T MRI improves tremor as measured by the clinically validated Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale after six months of DBS.

Secondary outcomes are: disease related daily functioning, adverse effects, operation time, quality of life, patient satisfaction with treatment outcome and patient evaluation of treatment burden.

Study design: The study will be a single center prospective observational study.

Study population: Enrollment will be ongoing from June 2023. Intervention (if applicable): No intervention will be applied. Application of 7T MRI for DBS is standard care and outcome scores used will be readily accessible from the already existing advanced electronic DBS database.

Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is the change in motor symptoms as measured by the disease-specific Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale (TETRAS). This is measured after 6 months of DBS as part of standard care. The secondary outcome measures are the Amsterdam Linear Disability Score for functional health status, Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire, patient satisfaction with the treatment, patient evaluation of treatment burden, operating time, hospitalization time, change of tremor medication, side effects and complications.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The proposed observational research project involves treatment options that are standard care in daily practice.

NCT02712515,The Motor Network in Essential Tremor: Mechanisms of Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02712515,,RECRUITING,"Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common movement disorders, and is the most prevalent tremor disorder. It is a progressive, degenerative brain disorder that results in increasingly debilitating tremor, and afflicts an estimated 7 million people in the US (2.2% of the population) and estimates from population studies worldwide range from 0.4% to 6.3%. ET is directly linked to progressive functional impairment, social embarrassment, and even depression. Intention (kinetic) tremor of the arms occurs in approximately half of ET patients, and is typically a slow tremor (\~5-10Hz) that occurs at the end of a purposeful movement, and is insidiously progressive over many years. Based on direct and indirect neurophysiological studies, it has been suggested that a pathological synchronous oscillation in a neuronal network involving the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus, the premotor (PM), primary motor (M1) cortices, and the cerebellum, may result in the production of ET. In spite of the numerous therapeutic modalities available, 65% of those suffering from upper limb tremor report serious difficulties during their daily lives. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment option for those suffering from medically refractory ET. The accepted target for ET DBS therapy is the Vim thalamus. Vim projects to PM, M1, and supplementary motor areas (SMA) and receives afferents from the ipsilateral cerebellum. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings from Vim during stereotactic surgery have identified ""tremor cells"" that synchronously discharge with oscillatory muscle activity during tremor. Clinical and computational findings indicate that DBS suppresses tremor by masking these ""burst driver"" inputs to the thalamus. The overall goal is to investigate the neural signatures of tremor generation in the thalamocortical network by recording data during DBS implantation surgery. Investigators will record data from the macroelectrode implanted in the Vim for DBS therapy, and through an additional 6-contact subdural cortical strip that will be placed on the hand motor cortical area temporarily through the same burr hole opened for the implantation of the DBS electrode.",NO,Essential Tremor|Parkinson's Disease,PROCEDURE: Deep brain stimulation implantation surgery|DEVICE: Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation Corp. electrodes/subdural strips|DEVICE: FHC Guideline 4000+ system and/or Medtronic RC+S,"Brain signals between the groups, FHC Guideline 4000+ system or Medtronic devices will be connected to Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation Corp. electrodes and deep brain electrodes to measure brain signals between the groups, intraoperative",,,University of Florida,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|Medtronic,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,50,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,IRB201600172-N|03UH3NS095553,2016-03,2023-11-03,2023-11-03,2016-03-18,,2023-05-31,"University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32611, United States",

NCT00971854,Alteration of Deep Brain Stimulation Parameters for Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00971854,,UNKNOWN,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves placing electrodes into the brain. Through these electrodes, artificial electrical signals are chronically delivered into deep brain regions in order to alter abnormal brain activity. The artificial electrical signals are generated by a battery that is inserted under the skin of the chest. DBS is used to treat several disorders of movement, including dystonia. In dystonia, the electrodes are inserted into a brain region called the globus pallidus.

Globus pallidus stimulation can be very effective therapy for dystonia. However not all patients are equally responsive and therapeutic outcomes can be frustratingly variable. The reason for this variability is unclear. Such variability in response may need to be met by tailoring stimulation to individual patients.

Another issue with deep brain stimulation is battery life. Eventually, batteries become depleted and need to be replaced. Such battery replacements require an operation, hospital stay and the risk of introducing infection. The high electrical energy that has been used to treat dystonia means that batteries are typically replaced every year or two.

The artificial electrical signals of deep brain stimulation are delivered with three parameters; frequency (Hertz - Hz), voltage (volts) and pulse width (microseconds). It has recently been reported that lower frequency stimulation, at 60Hz rather than 130Hz, can be used effectively to treat dystonia. Such 60Hz stimulation may be more effective for some patients than others. The lower energy demands of 60Hz stimulation would also greatly improve battery life (potentially doubling battery life).

The aim of this study is to assess if 60Hz stimulation is more effective in ameliorating the dystonia of patients who have responded poorly to 130Hz pallidal stimulation.

The TETRAS Activities of Daily Living Subscale (TETRAS-ADL) rates tremor's impact on activities of daily living, using 12 test items with each item scored from 0-4 (increasing with severity). The TETRAS-ADL total score range is 0-48.

The TETRAS performance subscale (TETRAS-P) consists of 16 scored items designed to measure essential tremor of the head, face, voice, upper extremity, lower extremity and trunk, with each item scored from 0-4 (increasing with severity). Specific amplitude measurements are used to guide the ratings for each item. Tasks of spiral drawing, handwriting and object holding are included. The TETRAS-P total score range is 0-64.

The total TETRAS score, including both TETRAS-ADL and TETRAS-P, ranges from 0 to 112., 4 months","Instrumented Tremor Measurement, Quantitative measurements of upper extremity tremor can add power to clinical treatment trials 10,11 . Inertial measurement units (IMU) are lightweight, wearable motion sensors that offer a reliable means for the objective measurement of tremor 12 . In this trial Delsys IMU's will provide a secondary measure of tremor amplitude using recordings from a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope. IMU's will be attached to the arm muscles and recordings will be made during the upper extremity postural and action tasks of the TETRAS-P assessment, without adding additional assessment time., 4 months|Bain Tremor Disability Scale (BTDS), The Bain Findlay Tremor Activities of Daily Living scale is a 25-item self-administered questionnaire assessing items related to eating, hygiene, writing and other daily tasks (item rating 1-4, total score 25-100, increasing with severity). The scale is reliable in test-retest measures, although the correlation of disability scores to tremor amplitude measurements is not established., 4 months|Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST), QUEST is a quality of life measure specifically designed for essential tremor . The scale is a self-administered questionnaire of 30 items clustering around five factors: Physical, Psychosocial, Communication, Hobbies/Leisure, and Work/Finance. QUEST has good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient \>=.89) and correlates best with overall quality of life measures rather than upper extremity tremor severity., 4 months|Quantitative Archimedes Spirals, Visual ratings of Archimedes Spiral drawing provide one of the most sensitive measures of tremor. Recording the spiral drawing on a digitizing tablet increases the sensitivity of tremor detection and can replace or augment clinical tremor measures. In this trial, patients will draw spirals on a Windows Surface tablet to obtain a quantitative measure of upper extremity tremor severity. The drawn spirals will be analyzed in MATLAB to output a score which correlates to severity of tremor., 4 months|Dot Approximation Task, Subject will hold a pen/stylus above a dot on a white sheet of paper for \~10 seconds and try to keep the tip of the pen/stylus as close as possible to the dot without touching it. A MBIENTLAB IMU sensor will be wrapped around the middle finger to assess tremor. Data from the sensor will be logged in the tablet and analyzed in MATLAB to output a score. This task is a testing item in the TETRAS-P7. While TETRAS is challenging to assess remotely, the Dot Approximation Task is easy to perform and provides a sensitive, quantitative measure of tremor. Both the Quantitative Archimedes Spirals and Dot Approximation Tasks will be used for at-home self-assessment of tremor., 4 months|Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS), The BARS was developed as a short screening instrument to rate cerebellar function in five realms: Gait, Kinetic Function-Arm, Kinetic Function-Leg, Speech, and Eye Movements. The scale is reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient = .91), internally consistent and correlates highly with other more detailed scales. The scale can be administered in minutes making it ideal for repeated assessment of dysfunction in cerebellothalamic pathways., 2 months|Quantitative Gait Analysis, Gait ataxia is another common side-effect of DBS for ET. Marker-less pose estimation will be used to obtain a quantitative measure of gait ataxia by tracking the joints while the subject walks in a heel-to-toe, or tandem, manner. This data will be analyzed using DeepLabCut in Matlab to compute parameters such as midline deviation, gait speed, and wrist sway. Increased midline deviation and/or missteps, and a decrease in tandem gait speed will indicate gait ataxia., 2 months|Quantitative Speech Analysis, Stimulation-induced dysarthria is a common side effect of DBS for ET. In this trial, speech tasks will be recorded and analyzed to compute several parameters. During the speech recording, the subject will perform the oral diadochokinesis task by repeating the syllables /ka/, /pa/, or /ta/ ten times each recruiting a different structure of articulation.

NCT02585154,Studying Movement Control in Parkinson's Disease Using Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02585154,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease is a common, disabling, progressive condition characterised by severe problems with movement for which medical treatment in the longer term can be unsatisfactory. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment, which directly stimulates the nerve cells affected inside the brain to help overcome the difficulties with movement. Classically, deep brain stimulation stimulates in a manner that is constant and independent of a patients underlying condition as reflected in their brainwave activity. Recent research has suggested that adjusting deep brain stimulation in real time using analyses of brain signals recorded from deep brain stimulation electrodes (termed closed loop deep brain stimulation) nay be better than classical deep brain stimulation in alleviating difficulties with movement. However, it remains unclear whether closed-loop deep brain stimulation also leads to fewer unwanted side effects on movement control. In order to answer this question, the investigators will analyze deep brain stimulation activity and activity recorded from the surface of the head in Parkinson's disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. During the recordings patients will perform different movement tasks. Deep brain stimulation has been found to reduce patients' ability to suppress inappropriate movements in certain tasks and performance in these tasks will be the core point of interest. The recordings will be conducted three times: During closed loop deep brain stimulation, classical deep brain stimulation and while the stimulator is turned off.

The benefit of 60Hz stimulation persisted during the 6-week study period, but with worsening tremor in one patient. However, it remains unknown whether the benefit of 60Hz would persist on prolonged stimulation period, and whether there is carry-over effect across different conditions. Hence, the investigators would like to test the hypothesis that the 60Hz stimulation, compared to 130Hz might have persistent benefit over an extended period in reducing the swallowing dysfunction, FOG, and other axial symptoms in these PD patients even after correcting the potential carry-over effect.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DEVICE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) at 60 Hz|DEVICE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) at 130 Hz|DEVICE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Off (Sham),"Frequency of Aspiration Events on Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study at Visit 1, A speech pathologist used the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) to rate swallows captured by a radiologist during VFSS recording.

NCT04703556,Recording and Modulation of Brain Activity Through Chronically Implanted Stimulation Electrodes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04703556,PDNeuroGAIT,TERMINATED,"For decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies have been employed very successfully to alleviate segmental motor symptoms (tremor, brady-kinesia or rigidity) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately these therapies often fail to alleviate, or can even aggravate, axial deficits such gait and balance disorders. This is presumably due to the divergence in the dynamics of the circuits that control leg function, which are not well addressed with commonly employed stimulation protocols.

To date, patients still endure life-long debilitating gait difficulties that severely affect their everyday mobility, independence and quality of life.

In recent years, a handful of studies have proposed new paradigms, for instance using different stimulation parameters that are thought to be better suited for targeting the circuits that control lower limb function.

As a result, the relevant approaches for therapeutic intervention remain unclear, and the underlying mechanisms largely unknown.

NCT04922411,Cortical Network Modulation by Subthalamic Nucleus DBS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04922411,,RECRUITING,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) can provide substantial motor benefit yet can also produce unwanted mood and cognitive side effects. Although the neural mechanisms underlying benefits and side effects are not well understood, current hypotheses center on the potentially measurable yet currently undefined effects within downstream cortical networks. Limitations of current tools have impeded attempts to assess network connectivity directly and dynamically in humans with implanted DBS; PET lacks the necessary temporal resolution while fMRI is neither optimal nor safe for patients with implanted DBS. In this proposal, to overcome these significant limitations, the investigators apply high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) methods to investigate how STN DBS modulates cortical functional networks and behavior in PD patients. HD-DOT uses a collection of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements, free of radiation exposure concerns, and without electrical/metal artifacts or contraindications or safety concerns for DBS. However, common fNIRS systems are critically hampered by typically sparse measurement distributions that lead to poor anatomical specificity, unreliable image quality due to crosstalk with scalp signals, poor spatial resolution, limited field of view, unstable point spread functions, and uneven spatial coverage. HD-DOT solves these problems by using high-density interlaced source and detector imaging arrays that support densely overlapping measurements and anatomical head models that together result in higher spatial resolution, stable point spread functions, and greatly improved isolation of brain signals from scalp signals. The investigators have demonstrated that HD-DOT accurately maps functional connectivity (FC) within and between cortical resting state networks (RSNs) in the outer \~1cm of cortex with comparable temporal and spatial resolution to fMRI. Preliminary data in older controls and STN DBS patients that directly establish validity and feasibility for the proposed studies are provided.

A recent comprehensive evaluation of FC in PD (without DBS) using fMRI found reduced within-network FC in visual, somatomotor, auditory, thalamic and cerebellar networks and reduced between-network FC involving predominantly cortical RSNs (somatomotor, sensory and association), some of which correlated with cognitive and motor dysfunction in PD. Notably, striatal RSNs were not abnormal. These data suggest that PD affects the interrelationships of cortical networks in a behaviorally meaningful way, far downstream of focal subcortical neuropathology. STN DBS is known to alter activity in downstream cortical regions that function as nodes within these dynamic cortical networks supporting movement and cognition. Thus, cortical network FC may play a critical role in mediating the impact of STN DBS on motor and non-motor behavior. Location of the stimulating contact may further modulate these downstream effects, due to the complex functional organization of the STN region.

Study procedures include motor and cognitive tests, questionnaires, HD-DOT scanning, and MRI scans.

The investigators propose to investigate how STN DBS influences downstream cortical network FC using HD-DOT.

This information could lead to more efficient clinical optimization of DBS, identify potential cortical targets for less invasive neuromodulation, and lay the groundwork for future more complex experimental manipulations to determine the full range of STN DBS-induced cortical network responses to up-stream focal electrical perturbations, revealing fundamental properties of functional network plasticity.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Deep Brain Stimulation,DEVICE: STN DBS,"Functional Connectivity measures, Average correlation values for specific functional networks (Somatomotor, visual, auditory and frontoparietal) obtained from HD-DOT., measures will be fully available at the end of this 5 yr study",,,Washington University School of Medicine,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,201908154|1R01NS109487-01A1,2021-04-23,2026-04,2026-04,2021-06-10,,2023-03-21,"Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States",

Demonstrate functional markers derived from electrophysiological signals recorded during cognitive tests. These markers should make it possible to optimize the targeting procedures of electrode implantation sites for a better effectiveness of deep brain stimulation therapy.

Research hypotheses

The mechanisms of action of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) involve the modulation of the activity, locally and on a large scale, of functional cortical-subcortical networks showing pathological behavior beforehand. The electrophysiological measurements in response to different tasks make it possible to highlight precise dysfunctions of these neural networks, in relation with the behavioral and / or motor disorders associated with the pathologies treated by DBS.

Consequently, we hypothesize that the exploitation of electrophysiological responses during cognitive or sensorimotor tasks performed during the implantation procedure of stimulation electrodes in patients treated with DBS will allow :

* To collect fundamental data to understanding the physiological functioning of basal ganglia in humans ;
* To collect functional markers from the operating room in relation to the symptoms targeted by the DBS that will help in the choice of implantation site of the stimulation electrode ;

NCT05968976,Multicentre RCT of Awake Versus Asleep Tractography Based DBS for ET,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05968976,TREMBLE,RECRUITING,"Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamus is an effective surgical treatment for patients with disabling essential tremor, despite optimal pharmacological treatment. To date, the standard DBS procedure is performed under local anesthesia which is very burdensome for patients. It is now possible to directly visualize the target (motor) area in the thalamus due to advances in modern imaging techniques. DBS surgery could be performed under general anesthesia (asleep).

Objective: The primary objective of the study is to determine whether asleep thalamic DBS surgery provides an equal tremor reduction compared to awake thalamic DBS surgery, measured by the clinically validated Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale after six months of DBS.

Secondary outcomes are: disease related daily functioning, adverse effects, operation time, quality of life, patient satisfaction with treatment outcome and patient evaluation of treatment burden.

Study design: The study will be a multicentre prospective randomized open label blinded (PROBE) endpoint trial comparing thalamic DBS under general versus local anesthesia.

Study population: A total of 110 patients with disabling essential tremor despite optimal pharmacological treatment will be randomized.

Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be randomized for asleep DBS or awake DBS. According to the standard DBS procedure, two brain-electrodes are connected to an implanted neurostimulator, which is placed subcutaneously in the subclavicular area

Main study parameter/endpoints: The primary outcome measure is the change in tremor score on the Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale after 6 months of thalamic DBS.

The secondary outcome measures are the Amsterdam Linear Disability Score for functional health status, Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire, patient satisfaction with the treatment, patient evaluation of treatment burden, operating time, hospitalization time, change of tremor medication, side effects and complications.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Awake DBS at present is very burdensome and by many patients and health care providers considered to be an overly invasive treatment for essential tremor. Through this trial, we aim to investigate whether asleep DBS in essential tremor can become the new treatment standard. This is expected to increase the accessibility for DBS and subsequently would allow more people with essential tremor to be helped, as well as in an earlier stage of their disease than currently; more patients will benefit for a longer time period from DBS. Asleep DBS will have a shorter procedure length. The proposed research project involves treatment options that are standard care in daily practice. The therapies will not be combined with other research products. Both treatments have a low risk of serious complications and a higher risk of minor side effects. Regular follow up will be used.

However, as PD is a complex neuropsychiatric disease, it has been hypothesized that in some patients, non-motor features, i.e. dysfunctional expectations for the result of neurosurgery, could interfere with postoperative result of DBS, even in case of motor improvement. Recent literature highlights the necessity to take these preoperative expectations into account, but to our knowledge, no specific scale investigating these cognitions in this PD-specific condition is available. So, the investigators developped the DBS-PS, a self-scale constructed to measure preoperative expectations for DBS, with 11 questions and visuo-analogical responses (1 to 10), theorically divided in three domains investigating the expectations concerning symptoms of PD, postoperative social-life and leisures, and postoperative familial and marital sphere.

NCT01485276,Combined Deep Brain Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01485276,,WITHDRAWN,"Background:

- Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an approved treatment for Parkinson s disease. It stimulates a part of the brain that helps control symptoms like tremor, stiffness, and slow movements. However, many people continue to have unsteadiness and slowness while walking, trouble swallowing, and speech problems even with STN DBS. Another type of DBS focuses on a part of the brain called the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). PPN DBS has improved walking in some people with Parkinson's disease. Researchers want to see if combining the two types of DBS may help control symptoms better than STN DBS alone.

Objectives:

* To see if PPN DBS can help walking, balance, speaking, and swallowing in those who already have STN DBS.
* To study how the DBS combination affects brain function.

Eligibility:

- Individuals with Parkinson s disease who had STN DBS surgery at least 1 year ago, but still have difficulty walking, swallowing, and speaking.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also have neurological tests and other tests to measure Parkinson s disease symptoms.
* This study requires eight visits over 1 year. One of the visits will be a 9- to 10-day admission to the NIH Clinical Center for DBS surgery.
* Participants will have PPN DBS surgery. The surgery will be done in two steps. In the first step, the leads will be placed in the brain. In the second step, 1 week later, the stimulator device will be placed in the chest or abdomen.
* One month after the surgery, participants will have a study visit to program the PPN DBS device to find settings that will improve walking and balance.
* Participants will have study visits 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Each visit will be used to check the stimulators and make any adjustments needed to try to improve walking and balance or to lessen side effects. Participants will have tests of walking and balance, speech, and swallowing. Some tests will be done with different combinations of the stimulators on or off to see the effects of each set of stimulators.",NO,Parkinson Disease,PROCEDURE: DBS Surgery,Change in the amount of time needed to complete a standardized timed up and go (TUG) study at 6 months post-surgery on stimulation,"TUG study at 1, 3 and 12 months post-surgery.|UPDRS III score and UPDRS III points 27-30 at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months|PDQ 31 questionnaire at 6 months|Swallowing function at 6 moths|Static and dynamic posturography parameters at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months on stimulation.",,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,0,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,120012|12-N-0012,2011-11-08,,2014-07-30,2011-12-05,,2019-11-15,,

NCT02468843,Novel Stimulation Patterns for the Treatment of Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02468843,,COMPLETED,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical therapy for select Dystonia patients who are refractory to medications or who have generalized symptoms (e.g. patients with Early-Onset Primary Dystonia(DYT1) mutations and other dystonia subtypes). DBS patients typically experience significant improvement in disabling symptoms; however, detailed programming is always required, and stimulation-induced side effects commonly emerge. Clinicians may empirically vary voltage, pulse width, frequency and also the active contacts on the DBS lead to achieve observed optimal benefits.

The majority of DBS patients undergo repeat surgeries to replace the implantable pulse generator (IPG) every 2.5 to 5 years. It has been demonstrated that, in dystonia patients, that higher settings are required for adequate symptomatic control, and that neurostimulators have a considerably shorter life when compared to neurostimulators from patients with essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. Additionally, several smaller studies have suggested that alternative pulse stimulation properties and pulse shape modifications can lower IPG battery consumption.

Newer patterns of stimulation (regularity of pulses and shapes of pulses) have not been widely tested in clinical practice, and are not part of the current FDA device labeling. Novel patterns of stimulation do however, have the potential to improve symptoms, reduce side effects, and to preserve the neurostimulator life.

The current research proposal will prospectively study biphasic pulse stimulation paradigms and its effects on dystonic symptoms.

Studies have shown that the improvement of movement disorder symptoms in patients receiving DBS is a potential therapy. treatment approach. However, at present, there are few large-sample studies in this area at home and abroad, which cannot well reveal its actual therapeutic effect and safety, and do not fully understand its potential neural mechanisms, so it is impossible to form a unified and standardized treatment standard, which limits its wide application in clinical practice. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of hemiplegia recovery after deep brain electrical stimulation in stroke patients with hemiplegia. Methods/Design: This was a double-blind randomized cross-over controlled pilot study in which 62 patients were assigned to receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) and randomized into DBS and control groups using a randomized controlled study approach, DBS group One month after the operation, electrical stimulation was started, and the control group was given sham stimulation treatment. After 3 and 6 months of follow-up, all the machines were turned off. After a 2-week washout period, the control group was turned on, but the DBS group was given sham stimulation. After the 9th and 12th month of follow-up, all patients were given start-up treatment, and neuroimaging and various post-stroke motor-related scores were performed for data collection and analysis. Discussion: The investigators propose a research design and rationale to explore the effectiveness and safety of DBS in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, and provide evidence and reference for DBS in the treatment of post-stroke dyskinesia. Study limitations are related to the small sample size and short study time period.",NO,Stroke Sequelae,PROCEDURE: MLR-DBS|PROCEDURE: Conventional rehabilitation group,"Motor function intervention effect: Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FMA), Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FMA) was used to measure the motor function of stroke patients.

The classical procedure consists in STN indirect targeting based on stereotactic atlases or statistical coordinates in AC-PC (Anterior Commissure - Posterior Commissure) referential along with target control and correction by micro-electrode recordings (MER) and awake clinical testing. To avoid potential complications and patient discomfort related to current procedure, asleep surgery without this control process has become more and more performed, essentially thanks to the progress of neuroimaging allowing to STN visualization. However, it has been reported a relative inaccuracy between the ""radiological"" STN delimitated on several types of MRI sequences (T2, T2\*, SWI) and the per-operative electrophysiological findings. As a result, there are currently many types of STN-DBS procedures, and the lack of standardization between techniques complicates the interpretation of postoperative results on anatomical, electrophysiological and clinical points of view. Furthermore, to date, it has not been proven that asleep surgery without MER and clinical controls is as effective as the standard procedure in a prospective controlled randomized clinical trial.

Investigators hypothesize that the clinical-based 18 landmarks STN target will be precise enough to allow to perform surgery under general anesthesia without MER correction, and accurate enough to achieve non inferior clinical results compared to what is usually done in each centre.

Cervical dystonia symptoms can in most patients be managed well by botulinum toxin (BTX) injections, and supporting treatment measures. However, one-fifth to one-third of patients do not obtain sufficient relief from long-term BTX therapy, resulting in reduced quality of life. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment method in which electrodes are surgically implanted permanently in the brain to modulate brain networks and function. In cervical dystonia, DBS of the postero-ventral part of the internal globus pallidus (GPi-DBS) has been established as an effective treatment for severe cases. However, the outcome of GPi-DBS in cervical dystonia has been reported mostly in some smaller series with up to 3 years follow-up. Thus, there is a lack of documentation of outcome of GPi-DBS in CD beyond 3 years of treatment and in larger patient materials. In this study the investigators will perform a long-term follow-up study of patients who were operated with a DBS-device targeting the GPi bilaterally, and who have been treated with chronic GPi-DBS for a minimum of 3 years.

NCT05362448,Neurophysiologic Assessment of ET Patients Treated by Vim DBS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05362448,,RECRUITING,"Essential tremor is a chronic and progressive neurological disease characterized by upper limb tremor. This is one of the most frequent movement disorders. Most of the time the disease worsens over the time, affecting patients' work abilities and in the most severe cases activities of daily living such as eating or dressing. For the most disabled patients, Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate median nucleus (Vim), a procedure consisting in an electrode implantation in a structure of the brain involved in tremor genesis, is the gold standard treatment. While this therapy is most of the time highly effective in alleviating the tremor, some subjects may exhibit gait impairment or upper limb coordination troubles years after the surgery, which are thought to be due to the involuntary stimulation of efferent cerebellar fiber tract. Unfortunately, this DBS induced side effect cannot be systematically avoided and may limit the possibilities of settings adaptation required to control the tremor. Surprisingly, while it could be a valuable therapeutic option for these patients suffering from DBS induced balance troubles, little is known about the effect of varying the rate of stimulation on the gait disorders associated with essential tremor and Vim DBS. The aim of or study is consequently to assess the effect of different frequency of stimulation on tremor, gait and balance disorders as well as on eye movements in patients uni or bilaterally stimulated in the Vim for a severe and medically intractable essential tremor.

Currently, adaptive closed-loop stimulation systems that apply disease-specific biomarkers, such as local field potentials (LFPs), are being actively examined to facilitate DBS programming. However, the most suitable feedback signal, still remains to be determined. The investigators previously tested the usefulness of the patient's subjective rating on a visual analogue scale (VAS) as a potential feedback signal for DBS adjustment and found that VAS-based programming lead to similar results as our standard approach. One of the practical advantages of using VAS-based programming strategies - in addition to saving time - is the principal applicability of such an approach to a remote programming setting, although a validation of such an approach is required. Within the scope of a prospective, randomized multicenter clinical trial (the REMOTE Trial), the investigators will examine the effectiveness and safety of VAS-based remote DBS programming in PD by using a novel and recently introduced software platform (Abbott NeurosphereTM Virtual Clinic) that allows for the programming through a smartphone-based video connection with the patient.

Numerous studies have been carried out on electrophysiological activity correlated with motor disorders, showing that akinesia is correlated with an abnormal synchronization in the beta frequency band (13-30Hz) in the dorsal motor part of the subnucleus. thalamic. This abnormal synchronization is reduced when the akinesia improves with dopaminergic treatment. On the cognitive-behavioural non-motor side, electrophysiological studies are less numerous, but suggest an involvement of the subthalamic nucleus (with an abnormal synchronization in the lower frequency bands). Currently, the electrophysiological correlates of neuropsychiatric fluctuations are unknown. In addition, all studies on electrophysiological activity are carried out immediately after the intervention, and before the implantation of the pacemaker. It is unknown whether the electrophysiological correlates of motor and non-motor fluctuations change following their transient improvement observed in the setting of chronic stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and chronic reduction of dopaminergic treatment.

Therapies have been developed that effectively target the motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms are far more disabling for patients, precede the onset of motor symptoms by a decade, are more insidious in onset, have been less apparent to clinicians, and are less effectively treated. Sleep dysfunction is oftentimes the most burdensome of the non-motor symptoms. There are limited options for treating sleep dysfunction in PD, and the mainstay of therapy is the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs without addressing the underlying mechanisms. Patients with PD who demonstrate significant motor fluctuations and dyskinesia are considered for subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Several studies have reported that STN-DBS also provides benefit for sleep dysregulation. Additionally, local field potentials recorded from STN DBS electrodes implanted for the treatment of PD, have led to the identification of unique patterns in STN oscillatory activity that correlate with distinct sleep cycles, offering insight into sleep dysregulation. This proposal will leverage novel investigational DBS battery technology (RC+S Summit System; Medtronic) that allows the exploration of sleep biomarkers and prototyping of closed-loop stimulation algorithms, to test the hypothesis that STN contributes to the regulation and disruption of human sleep behavior and can be manipulated for therapeutic advantage.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna (GPi) are two targets extensively studied and used worldwide in treating PD. Although the conventional SYMMETRIC bilateral STN and GPi DBS are shown to be effective in controlling motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor, and dyskinesia, each target has its pros and cons in terms of axial symptom control, medication reduction, cognitive decline, and programming. Therefore, we speculate that an ASYMMETRIC bilateral implantation of DBS leads (i.e., combined unilateral STN and contralateral GPi DBS) may be able to bring the greatest clinical benefits to PD patients by taking advantage of both bilateral STN and GPi DBS at the same time. The preliminary retrospective study containing eight PD patients undergoing asymmetric implantation of DBS demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this treatment strategy during short-term follow-up.

NCT00105430,Deep Brain Stimulation for Cervical Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00105430,,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treating primary generalized dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Medical therapies are available, but not all patients get adequate relief from the abnormal movements or the pain associated with them. DBS is a surgical procedure that interrupts neuronal circuits in the Gpi and STN, areas of the basal ganglia of the brain that do not work correctly in patients with dystonia. The surgery results in decreased movement and therefore may lessen patients' symptoms and pain.

Patients 7 years of age and older with generalized dystonia that does not respond to medical treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with blood and urine tests, chest x-ray, and an electrocardiogram in patients 35 years of age or more.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure usually lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, during which the patient is asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation. This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the patient may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the patient may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation, electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.
* Neurologic evaluation. Before and after DBS, the patient's dystonia, including voice strength and difficulty swallowing, are measured with a standardized rating scale.
* DBS treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to have electrodes implanted in either the Gpi or STN area of the basal ganglia. The electrodes are what stimulate the brain in DBS therapy. Before surgery, a frame is secured to the patient's head, and an MRI scan is done. DBS involves making two small incisions and two small holes in the skull, opening the lining around the brain, locating the Gpi or STN, securing the electrodes in place and connecting them to the pulse generator that is placed under the skin below the collar bone. Additionally, during the surgery, the patient is asked to move certain muscles. The muscle activity is recorded to gain a better understanding of the physiology of movement. After surgery, computed tomography (CT) and MRI scans are done to confirm placement of the electrodes.
* Stimulation and evaluation. After surgery, patients' movements are evaluated during and after stimulation. The changes in movement and function are videotaped and scored according to a rating scale. The optimal stimulation settings are determined and the stimulators are adjusted accordingly.
* Follow-up. Patients are evaluated, with videotaping, at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after surgery, and the stimulators are adjusted as needed.",NO,Dystonia|Generalized Primary Dystonia,PROCEDURE: Deep Brain Stimulation,Clinical effectiveness of DBS of the Gpi or STN will be measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Scale (BFM) and monitored over time to determine the effectiveness DBS and if there is an ideal anatomic stimulation site.@@@@@@@@@,"Determine the underlying pathophysiology of dystonia, and the mechanism of action of DBS.",,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,40,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: |Intervention Model: |Masking: |Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,050111|05-N-0111,2005-03,,2006-07,2005-03-14,,2006-07-06,"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

NCT05008289,Effects of Magnetic Stimulation of the Dorsal Spinal Cord on Gait in Patients With Parkinson´s Disease and Deep Brain Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05008289,TMS,UNKNOWN,"Gait disorders are symptoms that significantly compromise the quality of life and functionality of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). When they are not responsive to drug dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS), the management of these symptoms is a challenge in clinical practice. Although deep brain stimulation is useful in the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, gait symptoms remains a challenge in patients undergoing this therapy. This is because, in addition to adjustments in the DBS programming not adding evident benefit in some patients with gait disorders, motor symptoms tend to progress over the years. In this context, spinal cord invasive electrical stimulation was proposed as a potential and effective therapy in a group of patients with PD who presented with gait impairment. More recently, the application of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord has emerged as a possible therapeutic option, as it could stimulate neural elements in a non-invasive way. The general objective will be to study the effect of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord on gait in PD patients with deep brain stimulation refractory to dopaminergic therapy. The method of the present study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, phase II clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord in patients with PD and deep brain stimulation who present gait disorders refractory to dopaminergic therapy. The primary outcome will be the change in gait speed between pre-stimulation and post-stimulation conditions between the two groups (active and placebo) assessed using the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Secondary outcomes will be the effects of stimulation on other gait measures (speed, step length, stride length, cadence, step width, sway time, support time and the presence of blocks), other motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), cognitive alterations, quality of life and side effects.

NCT04810325,Brain Sensing in Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04810325,,UNKNOWN,"High-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment strategy for a variety of movement disorders including Parkinson's disease, dystonia and tremor1-5, as well as for other neurological and psychiatric disorders e.g. obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, cluster headache, Tourette syndrome, epilepsy and eating disorders6-11. It is currently applied in a continuous fashion, using parameters set by the treating clinician. This approach is non-physiological, as it applies a constant, unchanging therapy to a dysfunctional neuronal system that would normally fluctuate markedly on a moment-by moment basis, depending on external stressors, cognitive load, physical activity and the timing of medication administration.

Fluctuations in physical symptoms reflect fluctuations in brain activity. Tracking and responding in real-time to these would allow personalised approaches to DBS through stimulating at appropriate intensities and only when necessary, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy, preserving battery life and potentially limiting side-effects12. Critical to the development of such adaptive/closed-loop DBS technologies is the identification of robust signals on which to base the delivery of variable high-frequency deep brain stimulation.

Local field potentials (LFPs), which are recordable through standard DBS electrodes, represent synchronous neuronal discharges within the basal ganglia. Different LFP signatures have been identified in different disorders, as well as in different clinical states within individual disorders. For example, low frequency LFPs in the Alpha/Theta ranges (4-12Hz) are frequently encountered in patients with Dystonia13,14, while both beta (12-30Hz) gamma (60-90Hz) band frequencies may be seen in Parkinson's disease, when the patient is OFF and dyskinetic, respectively15,16. Equally, suppression of these abnormal basal ganglia signals through medication administration or high-frequency DBS correlates with clinical improvement. As such, they represent attractive electrophysiologic biomarkers on which to base adaptive DBS approaches.

Until recently, neurophysiological assessments were purely a research tool, as they could only be recorded either intra-operatively or for a short period of time post-operatively using externalised DBS electrodes. However, advances in DBS technology now allow real-time LFP recordings to be simply and seamlessly obtained from fully implanted DBS systems e.g. Medtronic Percept PC.

In this study, we will evaluate a cohort of patients with movement disorders and other disorders of basal ganglia circuitry who have implanted DBS systems. Recordings of LFPs and/or non-invasive data such as EEG, limb muscle activation and movement (surface EMG and motion tracking) under various conditions (e.g. voluntary movement, ON/OFF medications, ON/OFF stimulation) will allow us to evaluate their utility as markers of underlying disease phenotype and severity and to assess their potential for use as electrophysiological biomarkers in adaptive DBS approaches. These evaluations in patients with DBS systems with and without LFP-sensing capabilities will take place during a single or multi-day evaluation (depending on patient preference and researcher availability). This study will advance not only the understanding of subcortical physiology in various disorders, but will also provide information about how neurophysiological and behavioural biomarkers can be used to inform personalised, precision closed-loop DBS approaches.",NO,Movement Disorders|Dystonia|Parkinson Disease|Tremor,,"local field potential power (amplitude), 12 months|local field potential frequency (Hz), 12 months",,,"University College, London",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,65,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,296010,2021-07-01,2022-10-01,2022-10-01,2021-03-22,,2021-05-05,,

GBA mutation carriers with PD have a specific phenotype characterized by more significant motor dysfunction and reduced short-term visual memory function compared with their non-GBA counterparts.

NCT02641366,Electromagnetic Tracking to Measure Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02641366,,COMPLETED,"Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment option for individuals with debilitating tremors that do not respond to medical therapy. However, severe tremors, particularly those that develop after central nervous system insult or from multiple sclerosis, can be comprised of several underlying components that represent dysfunction within distinct brain circuits. Some of these dysfunctional brain circuits can be successfully treated with DBS while others respond poorly DBS therapy. For severe tremors, it can be very difficult to discriminate between the underlying components of a patient movement disorder and is exclusively dependent upon clinical expertise. Even with extensive clinical experience, it is difficult to reliably predict the results of DBS therapy for patients suffering from severe, debilitating tremor. In an attempt to gain more knowledge, an electromagnetic tracking system will be used which can precisely measure the position of a patient's upper extremity in space during routine neurologic examination. The goal is to use this tool to quantitatively identify various components of severe tremor, which can be discriminated based on oscillatory frequency and regularity of tremor amplitude.

NCT04074031,Transcranial Ultrasound Therapy of Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04074031,ULTRABRAINTher,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Context. Essential tremor (ET) is a common disease, disabling in severe forms and resistant to drug treatment. In patients with severe ET, invasive neurosurgical technique such as deep brain stimulation of the Ventral Intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus is used. Focused ultrasound therapy, creating a small lesion of VIM represents an effective therapeutic alternative of low morbidity with the advantage of not requiring the opening of the skull and penetration into the brain. This therapy is performed under stereotactic guidance. Validation of the target before lesioning is done by testing the clinical effect by a gradual increase in temperature, resulting in tremor reduction. However, the gradual temperature increase in the targeting phase is suboptimal because it can decrease the efficiency of the lesioning procedure. The aim of this research project is to test an innovation of fundamental physics developed by the Langevin Institute, which would allow the reversible modulation of nerve tissue by ultrasonic waves without heating, to predict the effectiveness of treatment of the chosen target within the VIM before creating an irreversible lesion.

Methodology: Fifteen patients with severe and resistant essential tremor will be included in the study. A multimodal MRI will be performed for target calculation using several targeting methods for VIM developed during step 1. For each target, the application of neuro-modulation by ultrasound will allow determine the effect obtained on the tremor (quantified with adequate clinical scales - as Tremor rating scale (CRST), and the recording of electromyographic activity of the upper limbs) and the absence of side effects. A definitive millimetric lesion will be performed at the level of the most relevant target in order to maintain the clinical effect obtained.

Traditionally, the procedure is performed awake and under local anaesthesia to facilitate intraoperative monitoring via microelectrode recording and test stimulation for exact electrode positioning. Advances in MR imaging allow for clear visualization of the STN and therefore direct targeting. Retrospective series suggest that MRI-guided and image (CT or MRI)-verified STN-DBS under general anaesthesia yields a similar motor outcome and quality of life (QoL) as awake and microelectrode recording-guided surgery with intra-operative clinical testing. MRI-guided and image (CT or MRI)- verified approach potentially has advantages in terms of patient experience and cost-effectiveness. The study proposed here is the first in the world to directly compare both methods.

Objective: To compare bilateral MRI-guided and CT-verified STN-DBS under general anaesthesia to awake microelectrode-guided bilateral STN-DBS with intra-operative clinical testing in terms of motor improvement.

Study design: A multicentre comparative effectiveness trial with a non-inferiority design. Study population: 158 PD people eligible for bilateral STN-DBS (79 in each arm).

Intervention: This study compares two modalities of standard treatment. One arm receives awake microelectrode recording guided bilateral STN-DBS under local anaesthesia with intraoperative clinical testing. The other arm receives MRI-guided and CT-verified bilateral STN-DBS under general anaesthesia.

NCT02055261,Pedunculopontine Nucleus Stimulation for Gait Disorders in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02055261,,COMPLETED,"The appearance of postural instability and gait disorders is a major turning point in the evolution of Parkinson's disease (PD). These axial symptoms are usually unresponsive to L-Dopa and represent a severe impairment for the patients due to frequent falls and reduced outside mobility. There is no effective pharmacological treatment available for these symptoms, and their pathophysiology is not well known : it is currently assumed that non-dopaminergic brainstem lesions participate to axial symptoms in PD. Surgically, these patients cannot benefit from high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) since this operation tends to even aggravate axial symptoms unresponsive to L-Dopa in some patients. A dysfunction of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) might be at the origin of these axial symptoms, since the PPN participates in the maintenance of posture and motion in primates. In PD patients, recent reports have suggested that low frequency stimulation of the PPN may equally improve gait and posture. However, these results are debatable due to methodological limitations, insufficient clinical evaluation and uncertain anatomical targeting. Thus, our aim is to propose a low frequency PPN stimulation to six advanced PD patients according to the usual criteria for STN DBS who are, however, unsuitable for this operation due to gait and posture disorders. We will perform a randomized, double-blind and cross over design (two months periods with and without DBS randomly assigned to each patient).

However, individual improvement after DBS remains variable and 50% of patients show insufficient benefit. To date, DBS-electrode placement and settings in the highly connected STN are based on 1,5-Tesla or 3-Tesla MR-images. These low resolution and solely structural modalities are unable to visualize the multiple brain networks to this small nucleus and prevent electrode activation directed at its cortical projections. By using structural 7-Tesla MRI (7T MRI) connectivity to visualize (malfunctioning) brain networks, DBS-electrode placement and activation can be individualized.

Objective: Primary objective of the study is to determine whether visualisation of cortical projections originating in the STN and the position of the DBS electrode relative to these projections using 7T MRI improves motor symptoms as measured by the disease-specific Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-III).

Secondary outcomes are: disease related daily functioning, adverse effects, operation time, quality of life, patient satisfaction with treatment outcome and patient evaluation of treatment burden.

Study design: The study will be a single center prospective observational study.

Study population: Enrollment will be ongoing from April 2023. Intervention (if applicable): No intervention will be applied. Application of 7T MRI for DBS is standard care and outcome scores used will be readily accessible from the already existing advanced electronic DBS database.

NCT04658641,Characterization of Complex Pulse Shapes in Deep Brain Stimulation for Movement Disorders Using EEG and Local Field Potential Recordings,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04658641,CHANNEL DBS,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease and essential tremor are chronic movement disorders for which there is no cure. When medication is no longer effective, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is recommended. Standard DBS is a neuromodulation method that uses a simple monophasic pulse, delivered from an electrode to stimulate neurons in a target brain area. This monophasic pulse spreads out from the electrode creating a broad, electric field that stimulates a large neural population. This can often effectively reduce motor symptoms. However, many DBS patients experience side effects - caused by stimulation of non-target neurons - and suboptimal symptom control - caused by inadequate stimulation of the correct neural target. The ability to carefully manipulate the stimulating electric field to target specific neural subpopulations could solve these problems and improve patient outcomes. The use of complex pulse shapes, specifically biphasic pulses and asymmetric pre-pulses, can control the temporal properties of the stimulation field. Evidence suggests that temporal manipulations of the stimulation field can exploit biophysical differences in neurons to target specific subpopulations. Therefore, our aim is to evaluate the direct neurophysiological effects of complex pulse shapes in DBS movement disorder patients. This will be achieved using a two-stage investigation: stage one will study the neural response to different pulse shapes using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Stage two will study the neural responses to different pulse shapes using intra-operative local field potential (LFP) recordings.

However, certain drugs are associated with unwanted side effects or residual effects upon awakening (e.g. sleepiness, ataxia) which can increase the risks of falls and fractures. In addition, there can be systemic consequences of long-term use. An alternative method of manipulating sleep is by stimulating the brain to influence the electroencephalogram (EEG). To date, there have been mixed results from stimulating superficial areas of the brain and, as far as we know, there has been no systematic attempt to influence deep brain activity.

Many patients suffering from movement disorders, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), also have disrupted sleep. Currently, at stages where drug treatment no longer offers adequate control of their motor symptoms, these patients are implanted with a deep brain stimulation system. This involves depth electrodes which deliver constant pulse stimulation to the targeted area. A similar system is used in patients with severe epilepsy, as well as some patients with chronic pain.

The aim of this feasibility study is to investigate whether we can improve sleep quality in patients with deep brain stimulators by delivering targeted stimulation patterns during specific stages of sleep. We will only use stimulation frequencies that have been proven to be safe for patients and frequently used for clinical treatment of their disorder. We will examine the structure and quality of sleep as well as how alert patients are when they wake up, while also monitoring physiological markers such as heart rate and blood pressure. Upon awakening, we will ask the patients to provide their subjective opinion of their sleep and complete some simple tests to see how alert they are compared to baseline condition which would be either stimulation at the standard clinical setting or no stimulation.

We hope that our study will open new ways of optimising sleep without the use of drugs, in patients who are implanted with depth electrodes.

NCT05101161,Neurofeedback Using Implanted Deep Brain Stimulation Electrodes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05101161,,RECRUITING,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a gold-standard symptomatic treatment option for Parkinson's disease (PD) and is also explored for a variety of other neurological disorders. The implantation of electrodes into deep brain areas has not only enabled the application of electrical stimuli, but has also provided researchers and clinicians with an unprecedented window to investigate aberrant neuronal activity right at the core of pathological brain circuits. Local field potentials (LFP) have already been readily investigated through externalised DBS electrode wires prior to internalisation and connection to an implantable neurostimulator. In the case of PD, motor symptoms have been evidenced to correlate with exaggerated beta oscillatory activity (13-35 Hz) in the LFP recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Firstly, beta activity recorded in the STN at rest in patients withdrawn from their medication has been correlated with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) across patients. Secondly, a reduction of signal power in the beta-band was correlated with clinical improvements of motor symptoms. Thirdly, the two main therapeutic strategies, the administration of L-Dopa, and high-frequency DBS both lead to a suppression of beta-synchronicity in the STN. Furthermore, beta-oscillations show fast and movement-dependent modulation over time and can serve as a biomarker and feedback signal to control the delivery of DBS. The investigators recently implemented deep brain electrical neurofeedback to provide real-time visual neurofeedback of pathological STN oscillations through externalised DBS electrodes and showed that PD patients were able to volitionally control and reduce subthalamic activity within a single 1 hour session. Moreover, neurofeedback-learnt strategies accelerated movements and could be retained in the short- and mid-term. Only recently, a newly developed neurostimulator, the Percept™ PC (Medtronic Neurological Division, Minneapolis, MN, USA), has been clinically approved, which can not only apply electrical impulses, but also enable the measurement and transmission of brain activity. This neurostimulator is now the first choice for implantations at the University Hospital Zurich and is used for a variety of neurological disorders. The investigators' goal is to investigate whether neurofeedback through a fully implanted deep brain stimulation device is possible and can lead to a better control of pathological oscillations as well as symptom mitigation. Having shown that endogenous control over deep brain oscillations is possible, the investigators will also test this novel therapeutic approach for pathologies other than PD that are also treated with DBS. Neurofeedback using implanted DBS electrodes will have the advantage of enabling longer and multiple-day training sessions, which the investigators hypothesise to have a larger impact on control over pathological deep brain oscillations and neurological symptoms, as such a fully implanted neurofeedback system no longer requires the externalisation of DBS wires and is as such no longer limited to the first two days after electrode implantation. All in all, the investigators will not exceed a total streaming time of 7 hours per patients (7 d of battery time), which the investigators deem justifiable with respect to a battery life of \> 5 years. This proposed research is highly significant as it will help our understanding of various neurological diseases that are highly prevalent in society (PD being, for instance, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease) and might culminate in novel, endogenous treatment strategies.

However, intraoperative application of DEX may affect the discharge activity of deep brain nuclei and reduce the discharge frequency of Subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons. At present, there is still a lack of prospective intervention research to explore the optimal dose that does not affect MER mapping in patients with Parkinson's disease. The present study uses the Dixon and Massey up-and-down method to analyze the EC50 of DEX in patients with PD undergoing STN-DBS sedation, to clarify the balance meets the sufficient comfort of patients without affecting the accurate target of MER and the optimal dosage of DEX for boundary recognition.",NO,PD - Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Dexmedetomidine,"EC50 and the corresponding 95%CI of DEX applied to PD patients undergoing STN-DBS are determined by the up and down method according to the normalized root mean square(NRMS) value of the MER sampled signal., We use the root mean square (RMS) value of the MER sampled signal recorded by the electrode, measured in volts, as the main parameter for evaluating electrode position. RMS values change with the electrode properties and other external drives related to the operating room; therefore, it is crucial to normalize the RMS to comparable values. Thus, each session's RMS in a trajectory is divided by the mean RMS of the first five stable sessions in the same trajectory. This normalized RMS (NRMS) is found to be a good measure as it reflects the relative change in the total power of the signal, which elevates dramatically entering the STN.

If the NRMS is higher than 2.0, a positive response is defined and the concentration of DEX will be added by 0.05µg/kg/h in the next patient. A negative response is defined as NRMS lower than 2.0, and in such cases the concentration of DEX is reduced by 0.3 µg/kg/h., during MER recording","STN pass length (mm), For STN identification and length, recordings within the thalamus, zona incerta, STN, and SNr are identified by an experienced neurophysiologist intraoperatively and reclassified independently offline.

NCT03778060,Long-Term Transcutaneous Stimulation and Essential Tremor: A PET Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03778060,,RECRUITING,"Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in the United States and affects up to 5% of the population. ET patients experience involuntary shaking of the hands, head and/or voice that can range from mildly limiting to severely disabling.

Treatment options are limited and there are currently no medications specifically designed to treat it, and medications that are prescribed to relieve tremors are often limited by either inadequate efficacy or intolerable side effects. A subset of essential tremor patients whose tremors are inadequately treated by medication choose to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate thalamic nucleus. DBS has been shown to be highly effective for tremor suppression. However, DBS carries significant risks. As a result, a very small (less than 3%) percentage of essential tremor patients undergo DBS therapy.

The medical technology company Cala Health has developed a wristband device (the Cala TWO) that offers individuals with essential tremor a novel non-pharmacological, non-invasive alternative, in the form of stimulation of peripheral nerves, to aid in hand tremor relief. This innovative form of therapy has the potential to have important health, quality of life, and economic benefits for essential tremor patients.

The present pilot study (Aim 1) will assess the effectiveness of 3-month twice daily treatment with the Cala TWO device to aid in the relief of hand tremors in adult essential tremor subjects that have been approved to undergo deep brain stimulation surgery at Mayo Clinic - Rochester. This study is a prospective, within subject, non-significant risk study at Mayo Clinic - Rochester, enrolling approximately 20 subjects.

A completely optional component of this study (Aim 2) is seeking to perform three standard PET/CT sessions on a subset of these subjects (n=10) at Mayo Clinic - Rochester to evaluate changes in brain metabolic activity as a result of 3 months treatment with the device. The first session would take place upon a subjects entry into the study (start of month 1) and prior to any treatment with the Cala device, a second the following day after a 40 minute treatment period with the Cala device, and a third session at the end of the third month.

Dopaminergic therapy such as L-Dopa and dopamine agonists usually leads to a dramatic improvement of symptoms, but disease progression nevertheless remains inevitable. Bilateral Deep brain stimulation in subthalamic nucleus is now considered the gold standard surgical treatment.

Parkinson'disease mainly affects the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system which is linked to the limbic system and could be responsible of a specific trouble in the recognition in some facial expression.

We hypothesise that patients with Parkinson'disease present a dysfunction of voluntary and automatic treatment of emotional information.

The main purpose of this study is to show if patients with Parkinson'disease present a lack of specific facial expression recognition of emotion and determinate more precisely if this alteration involves the cortical way (high frequency way) or the under cortical way (low frequency way).

NCT01581580,Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery for Movement Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01581580,,RECRUITING,"Background:

- Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an approved surgery for certain movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease, that do not respond well to other treatments. DBS uses a battery-powered device called a neurostimulator (like a pacemaker) that is placed under the skin in the chest. It is used to stimulate the areas of the brain that affect movement. Stimulating these areas helps to block the nerve signals that cause abnormal movements. Researchers also want to record the brain function of people with movement disorders during the surgery.

Objectives:

* To study how DBS surgery affects Parkinson s disease, dystonia, and tremor.
* To obtain information on brain and nerve cell function during DBS surgery.

Eligibility:

- People at least 18 years of age who have movement disorders, like Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia.

Design:

* Researchers will screen patients with physical and neurological exams to decide whether they can have the surgery. Patients will also have a medical history, blood tests, imaging studies, and other tests. Before the surgery, participants will practice movement and memory tests.
* During surgery, the stimulator will be placed to provide the right amount of stimulation for the brain. Patients will perform the movement and memory tests that they practiced earlier.
* After surgery, participants will recover in the hospital. They will have a followup visit within 4 weeks to turn on and adjust the stimulator. The stimulator has to be programmed and adjusted over weeks to months to find the best settings.
* Participants will return for followup visits at 1, 2, and 3 months after surgery. Researchers will test their movement, memory, and general quality of life.

NCT02786680,How Does STN-DBS Influence Emotional Conflict Decision in Parkinson's Disease: a EEG Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02786680,DBS-EMOTION,COMPLETED,"A large body of evidence points to impairment in the decoding of emotional stimuli in Parkinson's disease (PD). These changes seem to be related to dysfunction of the mesocorticolimbic projections leading to dysfunction of the limbic cortico-subcortical loop that, throughout the basal ganglia, projects to limbic cortical regions such as the anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, which are known to be involved in emotional processing. Thus, presumably the occurrence of non-motor psychic symptoms and fluctuations in PD would also rely on the degeneration of this circuitry. Dopamine modulation of emotions has been frequently reported both in healthy subjects or PD patients, but the effect of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) over mood symptoms is more controversial and there is still a paucity of data demonstrating its role in emotional processing. The objective of our study is to assess and compare the behavioral and electrophysiological effects of both dopamine and STN-DBS in PD during emotional processing.

In this study, the investigators will assess the feasibility of an aerobic exercise regimen in those with advanced PD and DBS, characterize the immediate and long-term changes in neuronal activity with exercise in PD, and assess the nonmotor impact of exercise in individuals with advanced PD and DBS.

The investigators will recruit individuals who are not regular exercisers and develop an individualized 3-month exercise plan with the assistance of physical therapists, using heart rate targets for moderate exercise. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and following 3-months of regular exercise. Field potentials will be noted at baseline, during exercise every 2 weeks, and then a final baseline at the end of 3 months in on-medication and on-stimulation states. This will allow for characterization of field potential changes over time both during exercise as efficiency improves as well as impact on baseline neuronal activity in the resting state. This study is novel in that most aerobic exercise studies target early PD subjects and rarely include those who have undergone DBS surgery. The study will specifically focus on the feasibility of developing an aerobic exercise regimen in those with more advanced disease as well as gathering preliminary data on the impact it will have on motor and nonmotor features in this cohort. In addition to the clinical outcomes, investigators are now able to capture neuronal activity with novel FDA-approved DBS technology, allowing us to non-invasively monitor real-time changes in the basal ganglia in those who have undergone DBS surgery.

The dystonias are a heterogeneous group of movement disorders that share the core clinical feature of abnormal involuntary muscle contractions in common. Pallidal DBS is an established therapy for severe cases with an average improvement in dystonia severity of 50-60%. However, outcomes are variable and difficult to predict, and clinical trials report up to 25% of Nonresponders. Variability in electrode placement and inappropriate stimulation settings may account for much of this variability in outcome. In addition, improvement in dystonia is delayed, often days to weeks after a change in DBS therapy, complicating programming.

Our group recently developed a computer model to predict optimal individualized stimulation settings in patients based on the outcome of a large cohort of of chronically treated patients. In-silico testing showed a 16.3% better mean group improvement with computer-assisted programming compared with physician-assisted programming and a dramatic reduction in non-responders (from 25% to 5%).

NCT00132340,Deep Brain Stimulation to Treat Cervical Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00132340,,COMPLETED,"This study will evaluate the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating primary dystonia. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Medical therapies are available, but not all patients get adequate relief from the abnormal movements or the pain associated with them. DBS is a surgical procedure that interrupts neuronal circuits in the globus pallidus interna (Gpi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) - areas of the basal ganglia of the brain that do not work correctly in patients with dystonia. This results in decreased movement and therefore may lessen patients' symptoms and pain. The study will also examine the physiology of dystonia and determine whether the treatment effects of DBS in the Gpi differ significantly from DBS of the STN.

Patients 18 years of age and older with primary cervical dystonia that does not respond to medical treatment or botulinum toxin (Botox) may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with blood and urine tests, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, see below) of the brain.

Each participant undergoes the following tests and procedures:

* Magnetic resonance imaging. This procedure is done after implantation of the stimulators to verify position of the electrodes. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain. The patient lies on a table that is moved into the scanner (a narrow cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure usually lasts about 45 to 90 minutes, during which the patient is asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation. This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the patient may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the patient may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. During the stimulation, electrical activity of muscles is recorded with a computer, using electrodes attached to the skin with tape.
* Neurologic evaluation. Before and after DBS, the patient's dystonia is measured with a standardized rating scale called the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Scale (TWSTRS).
* DBS treatment. Patients are randomly assigned to have electrodes implanted in either the Gpi or STN area of the basal ganglia. The electrodes are what stimulate the brain in DBS therapy. Before surgery, a frame is secured to the patient's head, and an MRI scan is done. DBS involves making two small incisions and two small holes in the skull, opening the lining around the brain, locating the Gpi or STN, securing the electrodes in place, and connecting them to the pulse generator that is placed under the skin below the collar bone. In addition, during the surgery, the patient is asked to move certain muscles. The muscle activity is recorded to gain a better understanding of the physiology of movement. After surgery, MRI scans are done to confirm placement of the electrodes.

NCT03371277,Attributional Style and Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03371277,ParkAIHQ,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder affecting 1-2% of the population over 65 years-old. In addition to the motor impairment characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability, patients suffer with non-motor symptoms such as dysautonomia syndrome, sleep disturbances, depressive disorders, delusional disorders and cognitive disorders. Research and management of these non-motor symptoms is essential because these can be disabling and have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Among cognitive functions, social cognition is defined as the aspect that is dedicated to process social information for adaptive functioning. More specifically, it refers to an intricate set of higher-order neuropsychological domains that allow for adaptive behaviors in response to others. Four dimensions are usually included in this construct: theory of mind (ToM), emotion processing, social perception and social knowledge, and attributional style. Recently, different categories of social cognition have been studied in patients suffering from PD, such as the ToM or the recognition of facial emotions. Other aspects of social cognition that seem relevant in this population are still poorly studied; the attributional style is a cognitive bias defined as ""the way we explain the causes of the positive or negative events that occur"". Indeed, different causes can be attributed to an event, and this attribution is shared between oneself, others and other factors related to the situation. People with attribution bias may mistakenly attribute to one cause all the situations. For example, when an individual blame the others for an event, he may develop a feeling of hostility that may lead to maladaptive behavior such as aggression and thus affect his social functioning. The impact of PD treatments, particularly deep brain stimulation (DBS), on the ToM has been studied, showing a deficit after stimulation. No study has assessed the impact of therapeutics on the attributional style of PD patients. In this context, it seems relevant to evaluate the effect of deep brain stimulation on the attributional style in this population.",NO,Parkinson's Disease,OTHER: Medical visit for specific questionnaires,"Attributional style, The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (Combs et al., 2006) will be used to assess attributional style, Day 0","depression, The Hamilton Depression Rating scale (Hamilton, 1967 )will be used to assess presence of depression, Day 0",,CHU de Reims,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,32,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,PO17112,2018-01-22,2018-07-07,2018-07-07,2017-12-13,,2018-10-26,"Chu Reims, Reims, 51092, France",

Modeling studies suggest that this therapy may result in current spread into the ventral STN, causing altered cognitive processes. As a result, current stimulation parameters often lead to worsening in verbal fluency, executive function, and, particularly, cognitive control. There is evidence suggesting that low frequency oscillatory activity occurs across brain circuits important in integrating information for cognition. Preclinical studies and human recording studies indicate these low frequency theta oscillations drive cognitive control during cognitive tasks.

It is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and affects around 1% of people over 60 years old. During the progression decline of substantia nigra and deficits of dopamine are observed. The diagnosis is usually based on the motor symptoms such as resting tremor, bradykinesia, muscle stiffness, and postural instability. Common intercurrent symptoms are psychiatric problems like depression or dementia (1). Pharmacotherapy, for example, L-dopa or deep brain stimulation (DBS) are usually used to reduce the motor symptoms (2).

From many years the influence of insufficient vitamin D3 levels in human is investigated. In recent publications it was proved that the deficiency of vitamin D3 may lead to generation of reactive oxygen species that influence negatively on mitochondria. That may lead to increased muscle atrophy (3,4). Deficiency of vitamin D3 may be also connected with depression, dementia or the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (5). Moreover, recently studies proved that PD patients have low concentration of serum vitamin D3 (5), increased serum homocysteine (6) and abnormalities in kynurenine pathway (7).

NCT00921128,Convection-Enhanced Delivery to Study the Pathophysiology Underlying the Clinical Features of Parkinson s Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00921128,,WITHDRAWN,"Background:

* Parkinson s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain cells that make the chemical dopamine. The primary medical treatment for PD has been to use medications to replace the dopamine that is missing from the brain. These medications can be effective at first, but after many years side effects and tolerance develop.
* Surgery can treat basic PD symptoms and complications. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers a safer alternative as the therapy can be adjusted and reversed to minimize side effects and optimize beneficial effects. DBS treats the symptoms of PD but does not alter its course.
* Infusions of neurochemicals or medications are another PD treatment method. NIH researchers have developed the technique of convection-enhanced delivery, which very precisely and consistently delivers infusions of many types into the brain. This project will allow researchers to infuse a medication, Muscimol, into the subthalamic region of the brain to see if it is as safe and effective as DBS.

Objectives:

* To determine whether an infusion of Muscimol into the brain is safe and relieves the symptoms of Parkinson s disease.
* To demonstrate that the infusion can be monitored with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using gadolinium.

Eligibility:

* Patients 18 years of age and older who have Parkinson s disease and are preparing for bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS surgery.
* Patients will be divided into two groups. One group of patients will have a partial infusion of Muscimol into the STN, and the second group of patients will have complete infusion of Muscimol into the STN.

Design:

* This study will begin 5 days before the patient undergoes bilateral subthalamic DBS surgery.
* On Day 1 of the study, small thin tubes (microcatheters) will be inserted into the STN through the same incision and burr holes that are used for DBS. Two infusion studies of Muscimol will be performed on successive days: the first without PD medication (Day 3 of study) and the second with PD medication (Day 4 of study).
* Each infusion will be monitored in the MRI suite, and researchers will perform clinical examinations of patients PD symptoms.
* Following the study experiments, a second surgery will be performed to remove the microcatheters and to place DBS electrodes in the standard fashion.",NO,Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Muscimol,"Determine potential effectiveness of PD symptom reversal by muscimol infusion.

Early intervention can reduce disability incidence, improve the patient's quality of life, and reduce the burden on families and society. Multiple international guidelines on dystonia have found deep brain stimulation (DBS) to be a safe and effective treatment for refractory dystonia. The globus pallidal internus (GPi) is the mostly widely used target for dystonia. However, there are limitations on the GPi DBS treatment, including slow onset of beneficial effects, poor improvement of axis symptoms, and potential stimulation-related side effects. Previous studies have described the highly successful use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS) in patients with refractory dystonia, suggesting that STN DBS is an effective and persisting alternative to pallidal deep brain stimulation. However, all STN DBS treated cases have been analyzed in open-label uncontrolled cohort studies, leading to limited data with a high level of evidence on the STN DBS in dystonia. Further, the investigators hypothesized STN has potentially more effectiveness when compared with GPi, and may be more power-saving and quick-acting.

NCT01355835,Combined STN/SNr-DBS for the Treatment of Refractory Gait Disorders in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01355835,STN/SNr,COMPLETED,12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and refractory gait disturbances under best individual subthalamic nucleus stimulation and dopaminergic medication will be included into this randomised double-blind cross-over two-armed clinical trial. The treatment consists of two different stimulation settings using (i) conventional stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus \[STNmono\] and (ii) combined stimulation of distant electrode contacts located in the subthalamic nucleus and caudal border zone of STN and substantia nigra pars reticulata \[STN+SNr\].,NO,Parkinson's Disease,"DEVICE: deep brain stimulation (ACTIVA PC, Medtronic)","'Axial score', The composite 'axial score' is built by 8 items from the UPDRS II and III, all 5-point rated (0 to 4) representing increasing levels of pathology. The 'axial score' will be scored by the sum of the ratings across the 8 items (Range 0 to 32). As change in UPDRS scores is a common primary efficacy outcome measure in Parkinson's disease and only items of the original UPDRS are required for the definition of the primary endpoint, the statistical evaluation methods should be based on the psychometric validation of the UPDRS and no own validation studies are necessary.
