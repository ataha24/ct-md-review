NCT02012647,Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02012647,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to examine the brain changes in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) after they get deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, compared with people who do not have Parkinson's Disease. Treatment of Parkinson's disease is often difficult and challenging. Deep brain stimulation is an established surgical treatment that is effective for the treatment of PD, but the details of why it helps are not known. In order to achieve maximum benefits from this treatment, it is important to understand how it changes the brain. Specifically, the investigators will study electrophysiology, which is the study of how the brain conducts electrical messages to the rest of the body. To do this, the investigators will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is a painless and non-invasive procedure. They will also conduct motor physiology experiments of the upper and lower limbs to collect data about skeletal muscle movement. The data from this study will help explain whether the electrical changes in the brain have any relation to the physical benefits patients with Parkinson's Disease sometimes receive from DBS surgery.",NO,Parkinson's Disease,PROCEDURE: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)|PROCEDURE: Motor Physiology Testing,"Motor Cortex Excitability, We will measure Motor Cortex Excitability by examining circuitries of inhibition found in the motor cortex which have a reduced function in Parkinson's Disease., As few as 1 days and up to 4 months","Relation between Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale outcomes and physiological measures, The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used by neurologists to rate the motor impairment of people with Parkinson's Disease.

NCT05537597,Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Musculoskeletal Pain in Patients With Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05537597,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Pain is an increasingly recognized non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), with significant prevalence and negative impact on the quality of life of patients.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the primary motor cortex（M1）has been proposed to provide definite analgesic effect for pain syndromes. However, very few placebo-controlled studies have been performed specifically to relieve pain in PD. What's more, based on behavioral measures alone, it is impossible to reveal the full network dynamics reflecting the impact of TMS.

Electroencephalography (EEG), with high temporal resolution, records signal that its origin in electrical neural activity, which makes it suitable for measuring TMS-evoked activation. By recording the TMS induced neuronal activation directly from the cortex, TMS-EEG provides information on the excitability, effective connectivity of cortical area, thus exploring cortical network properties in different functional brain states. In addition, the use of EEG offers great prospects as a tool to select the right patients in order to achieve adequate, long-term pain relief.

Besides assessing the efficacy and safety of high-frequency neuronavigated M1-rTMS in PD patients with musculoskeletal pain, the objective of this study additionally aimed to characterize cortical activation behind pain relief.

NCT02205216,Can tDCS Enhance Efficacy of Rehabilitative Intervention for Freezing of Gait in Parkinson's Disease?,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02205216,,UNKNOWN,"Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a major cause of disability and falls and responds often incompletely to conventional therapy. The pathogenesis remains largely unknown and therapeutic alternatives are needed.

Despite its ubiquity, a clear and consistent picture of the brain circuits mediating consciousness and responsiveness has not emerged. Studies to date are limited by lack of direct recordings in human brain during medically induced anesthesia. Our overall hypothesis is that the current model of consciousness, originally proposed to model disorders and recovery of consciousness after brain injury, can be generalized to understand mechanisms of consciousness more broadly. This will be studied through three specific aims. The first is to evaluate the difference in anesthesia sensitivity in patients with and without underlying basal ganglia pathology. Second is to correlate changes in brain circuitry with induction and emergence from anesthesia. The third aim is to evaluate the effects of targeted deep brain stimulation on anesthesia induced loss and recovery of consciousness. This study focuses on experimentally studying these related brain circuits by taking advantage of pathological differences in movement disorder patient populations undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that is used as treatment for movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, and provides a mechanism to acquire brain activity recordings in subcortical structures.

In one study, 25% of essential tremor patients were forced to change jobs or take early retirement because of tremor. Essential tremor is directly linked to progressive functional impairment, social embarrassment, and even depression. The tremor associated with essential tremor is typically slow, involves the hands (and sometimes the head and voice), worsens with intentional movements, and is insidiously progressive over many years. Deep brain stimulation has emerged as a highly effective treatment for intractable, debilitating essential tremor. However, since the intention tremor of essential tremor is typically intermittent, and commonly absent at rest, the currently available continuous deep brain stimulation may be delivering unnecessary current to the brain that increases undesirable side effects such as slurred speech and walking difficulty, and hastens the depletion of device batteries, necessitating more frequent surgical procedures to replace spent pulse generators.

This may result in abnormal postures. The underlying mechanisms are not known. One proposed mechanism is located in the motor area of the brain that controls the coordination of muscles, called the motor cortex. It is well known that the motor area of one hemisphere of the brain (motor cortex) controls the movement of the opposite side of the body. When people perform tasks such as picking up an object or writing there are mechanisms in motor cortex that focus the level of activity so that they can do these tasks with a high level of precision. Focusing activity in motor cortex seems to be disturbed in people with dystonia. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a device that allows the non-invasive stimulation of the brain. When applied to the motor cortex it can upregulate or down regulate its activity.

The total TWSTRS scale includes a global outcome score (total score) and scores on each of 3 subscales for severity (0-35), disability (0-30), and pain (0-20), which are summed together for a total score (0-85), with higher scores indicating greater impairment. The TWSTRS is completed by a neurologist who visually assesses the patient's symptoms, and asks the patient to self-report on pain and disability., absolute value at Week 12|SF-36 Physical Functioning Subscore, The Short Form 36-Item Health Scale (SF-36) is a health survey with 36 questions that is self-reported by the study participant. It contains 8 subscales, one of which is Physical Functioning, calculated from 10 of the 36 questions. Different questions have different score ranges and valences. Therefore, their response for each question is linearly transformed to a value of 0-100 (for example, choosing response 3 on a scale of 1-5 is transformed to 60). These ten values are then averaged to generate the Physical Functioning subscore, ranging from 0-100. The higher the response value and the subscore, the higher degree of physical functioning.

NCT00001663,Treatment of Cortical Myoclonus With Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001663,,COMPLETED,"Myoclonus is a condition related to epilepsy of involuntary twitching or jerking of the limbs.

The purpose of this study is to determine if stimulation of the brain with magnetic pulses can decrease myoclonus. Researchers believe that this may be possible because in studies on normal volunteers, magnetic stimulation made areas of the brain difficult to activate for several minutes. In addition, early studies on patients with myoclonus have shown magnetic stimulation to be effective at decreasing involuntary movements.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to stimulate brain activity and gather information about brain function. It is very useful when studying the areas of the brain and spinal cord related to motor activity (motor cortex and corticospinal tract). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of coil of wire (electromagnet) on the patient's scalp and rapidly turning on and off the electrical current. The changing magnetic field produces weak electrical currents in the brain near the coil. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

Researchers plan to use rTMS for 10 days on patients participating in the study. The 10 day period will be broken into 5 days of active repetitive magnetic stimulation and 5 days of placebo ""ineffective"" stimulation.

NCT04509349,Alternating Current Stimulation for Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04509349,,UNKNOWN,"Movement disorders are common neurological disorders, characterized by either excess or paucity of movements. Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common of these disorders, defined as chronic, rhythmic involuntary movements (tremor) that occur primarily during action involving the upper extremities as prominent body site. ET occurs in between 0.4% and 4% of adults below age 60, its prevalence and related impairment of routine daily actions increasing dramatically with age. More than half of patients do not regain functional independence with medications. These patients are offered functional neurosurgical approaches that carry procedural risk or adverse effects secondary to deep electric stimulation of surgical lesioning. Hence, there is a substantial need for alternative, non-invasive therapeutic options for this disabling neurological disorder. Recently, non-invasive neuromodulation applied as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), has emerged as promising for tremor control. In healthy subjects, tACS applied with a high definition (or focused) montage to the primary motor cortex (M1), was found to entrain physiological tremor; in patients with Parkinson's disease, tACS could decrease the amplitude of rest tremor when the stimulation was delivered in phase with, and at the same frequency of, the tremor. Tremor in ET could also be entrained applying ACS to the arm skin's peripheral nerves (transcutaneous ACS), but its effect on tremor amplitude is unknown.

METHODS AND POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION/IMPACT OF THE RESEARCH.

The proposed project aims to explore the whole potential of tACS for the tremor suppression in ET. The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses:

1. focused (or high definition, HD) tACS delivered over M1 at the same frequency of the tremor is effective in decreasing tremor amplitude in ET;

NCT01174771,Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Degeneration,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01174771,,COMPLETED,"Drug therapy of atypical parkinsonism is generally considered either ineffective or minimal 1. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternative therapies to treat atypical parkinsonian disorders. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive tool that modulates cortical excitability with minimal discomfort and holds therapeutic promise in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits that are affected in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticocbasal Ganglionic Degeneration (CBGD) are likely structurally and functionally segregated. The 'motor' circuit is implicated in parkinsonian akinesia and hypokinesia; a 'prefrontal' circuit is implicated in working memory and mood regulation, and linked with non-motor symptoms such as depression and apathy. In this proposal, we characterize motor and prefrontal network dysfunction in PSP and CBGD patients, and propose that high-frequency and low-frequency rTMS directed over separate motor and prefrontal cortical targets of each network may show specific and selective beneficial effects on motor vs. cognitive function in PSP and CBGD patients, respectively. Quantitative motor outcome measures include timed finger tapping tasks. Quantitative cognitive outcome measures comprise a visual analogue scale (VAS).

If successful, this pilot study will provide proof of principle data to suggest potential benefits for rTMS in PSP/CBGD patients, and provide sufficient data and experience to support future PSP/CBGD studies that include the use of rTMS to investigate the pathophysiology of motor and non-motor features of PSP and CBGD patients.",NO,Progressive Supranuclear Palsy|Corticobasal Degeneration|Parkinsonism,,"Cortical excitability (CE) measures expressed in motor evoked potentials (MEP), We assess cortical excitability (CE) with motor evoked potentials (MEP) and cortical silent periods (CSP) before and after repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)., 1 hour","visual analog scale (VAS), We assess mood with a visual analog scale (VAS) of 5 emotions and 1 overall feeling of well-being., 2 min|tapping speed, tapping speed (movement time and reaction time) will be measured, 5 min",,"University of California, Los Angeles",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,30,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,UCaliforniaLA|CurePSP,2008-10,2011-12,2012-02,2010-08-04,,2014-05-08,"UCLA, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States",
NCT02180139,tDCS in Cervical Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02180139,,WITHDRAWN,"Dystonia is a devastating disorder defined by involuntary, sustained muscle contractions or abnormal postures that can affect any part of the body. Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most pervasive form of dystonia affecting 60-90,000 individuals in the United States alone and is characterized by involuntary twisting of the neck. The symptoms of CD are disabling, disfiguring, painful, and have a strongly negative impact on quality of life, including social withdrawal and depression. At present, there is no treatment that has been shown to have long term benefit in CD. Standard of care (SOC) is botulinum toxin, which temporarily paralyzes affected muscles, resulting in reduced muscle spasms. This treatment has many undesirable side effects, variable effectiveness, is expensive, and must be repeated every 3 months throughout the lifespan. Physical therapy based treatments aimed at retraining posture or stretching dystonic muscles are largely ineffective and not typically delivered as a part of standard of care. There is an urgent need for novel and effective therapies. Emerging technologies, specifically non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS), have demonstrated compelling evidence to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with CD. In this study, individuals with cervical dystonia will be randomly assigned to receive tDCS for 15 minutes daily for 4 days in 1 of 4 stimulation location groups.

Hypothesis 1: One location of stimulation will result in clear benefit with at least 1 standard deviation (SD) improvement in the CDQ-24, the primary outcome measure, at 1-week follow-up.

Hypothesis 2: The cortical silent period will be the most sensitive measure investigated and will demonstrate significant increase in inhibition as determined by an elongation of silent period in the affected upper trapezius muscle.

Hypothesis 3: The stimulation location determined to be most effective in Objective 1 will produce the greatest physiologic change in inhibition increase.

Hypothesis 4: The hypothesis for this aim is if certain characteristics can predict response to treatment, a strong association will be seen between baseline measure(s) and the primary outcome measure. A thorough assessment of characteristics including: age, sex, duration of symptoms, genotyping for two specific polymorphisms, botulinum toxin history, baseline measures of outcome variables, measures of brain excitability, and genetic testing will predict response.",NO,Cervical Dystonia,DEVICE: transcranial direct current stimulation,"Cervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ-24), This primary outcome was selected because it is a patient-rated, disease-specific assessment of quality of life, which we feel should be the primary issue of concern., up to Day 6","Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS), Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale is an outcome measure used to rate severity, disability and pain in CD.

Research in healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects - hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, however, only null-effects have been reported in persons with PD. In the present study, the investigators will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the Serial Reaction Time task, in persons with PD. The investigators will determine immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also short-term (five minutes post-tDCS) and long-term (one week post-tDCS) consolidation effects, as previous studies suggest that tDCS exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL in a consolidation phase rather than in an acquisition phase.

NCT00001915,Study of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00001915,,COMPLETED,"Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a condition characterized by a decreased attention span, hyperactivity, and/or impulsiveness inappropriate for a certain age.

Typically, young children have what are known as subtle neurological signs. These are involuntary movements of one part of the body that occur while the child is making a voluntary movement of another part of the body. This is referred to as synkinesis, or overflow movements. These overflow movements disappear during normal development and are usually gone by the age of 10. However, in children with ADHD these overflow movements tend to be more intense and last long after the age of 10. This leads researchers to believe there is an abnormality in the maturation and development of the brain areas associated with motor activity in children with ADHD.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that gives information about brain function. It is very useful when studying areas of the nervous system related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). A magnetic signal given from a special instrument held close to the patient's head stimulates a small area of the brain that controls a few muscles (for example, the muscles that control one finger). Doctors put electrodes (small pieces of metal taped to areas of the body) over the muscle to measure the electrical activity the muscle produces when it makes a movement. When the magnetic signal activates those muscles the electrodes pick up and record the electrical activity of the movement that the muscles make in response to the magnetic signal.

Researchers will study normal children and those diagnosed with ADHD using TMS to find out if the clinical abnormalities of ADHD are associated with a delay or abnormality in maturation of areas of the nervous system responsible for motor activity (motor cortex and corticospinal tract).",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,,,,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,200,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,990034|99-N-0034,1999-01,,2004-02,1999-11-04,,2008-03-04,"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

NCT02712515,The Motor Network in Essential Tremor: Mechanisms of Therapy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02712515,,RECRUITING,"Essential tremor (ET) is among the most common movement disorders, and is the most prevalent tremor disorder. It is a progressive, degenerative brain disorder that results in increasingly debilitating tremor, and afflicts an estimated 7 million people in the US (2.2% of the population) and estimates from population studies worldwide range from 0.4% to 6.3%. ET is directly linked to progressive functional impairment, social embarrassment, and even depression. Intention (kinetic) tremor of the arms occurs in approximately half of ET patients, and is typically a slow tremor (\~5-10Hz) that occurs at the end of a purposeful movement, and is insidiously progressive over many years. Based on direct and indirect neurophysiological studies, it has been suggested that a pathological synchronous oscillation in a neuronal network involving the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus, the premotor (PM), primary motor (M1) cortices, and the cerebellum, may result in the production of ET. In spite of the numerous therapeutic modalities available, 65% of those suffering from upper limb tremor report serious difficulties during their daily lives. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as an effective treatment option for those suffering from medically refractory ET. The accepted target for ET DBS therapy is the Vim thalamus. Vim projects to PM, M1, and supplementary motor areas (SMA) and receives afferents from the ipsilateral cerebellum. Moreover, electrophysiological recordings from Vim during stereotactic surgery have identified ""tremor cells"" that synchronously discharge with oscillatory muscle activity during tremor. Clinical and computational findings indicate that DBS suppresses tremor by masking these ""burst driver"" inputs to the thalamus. The overall goal is to investigate the neural signatures of tremor generation in the thalamocortical network by recording data during DBS implantation surgery. Investigators will record data from the macroelectrode implanted in the Vim for DBS therapy, and through an additional 6-contact subdural cortical strip that will be placed on the hand motor cortical area temporarily through the same burr hole opened for the implantation of the DBS electrode.",NO,Essential Tremor|Parkinson's Disease,PROCEDURE: Deep brain stimulation implantation surgery|DEVICE: Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation Corp. electrodes/subdural strips|DEVICE: FHC Guideline 4000+ system and/or Medtronic RC+S,"Brain signals between the groups, FHC Guideline 4000+ system or Medtronic devices will be connected to Ad-Tech Medical Instrumentation Corp. electrodes and deep brain electrodes to measure brain signals between the groups, intraoperative",,,University of Florida,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|Medtronic,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,50,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,IRB201600172-N|03UH3NS095553,2016-03,2023-11-03,2023-11-03,2016-03-18,,2023-05-31,"University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32611, United States",

NCT01272154,Cerebellum and Cortical Plasticity: the Case of Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01272154,CERDYS,UNKNOWN,"Purpose

- Objective : Sensorimotor adaptation allows the modification of the motor command taking into account the errors detected during execution of prior movements. It involves a large cortico-subcortical network. Isolated lesions of this network do not systematically alter sensorimotor adaptation except for cerebellar lesions. The cerebellum is thus a key structure for sensorimotor adaptation. However, the link between cerebellar and the cortical plasticity underlying sensorimotor adaptation remain unknown. Alteration of sensorimotor adaptation is associated with dystonia but it is unclear whether it is a cause or consequence of dystonia. It has been hypothesized that the abnormal plasticity observed in dystonia could account for the associated alteration of sensorimotor adaptation.

Classically, basal ganglia dysfunction is considered to be crucial for dystonia pathogenesis. However, recent studies suggest that the involvement of the cerebellum may also be important in this setting. In primary dystonia, imaging studies showed abnormal cerebellar activation during sensorimotor adaptation tasks and neurophysiological studies demonstrated a decrease of cerebellar output.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the cerebellum in the cortical plasticity underlying sensorimotor adaptation both in healthy subjects (normal plasticity) and in dystonic patients (abnormal plasticity).

- Methods: Paired associative stimulation PAS consists in repetitive pairing of a peripheral nerve and a cortical stimulation. This kind of stimulation has been designed to induce artificial plasticity that can be easily measured. This PAS induced sensorimotor plasticity is exacerbated and has lost its topographical specificity in dystonic patients.TMS using trains of TMS pulses (rTMS) can be applied on the cerebellum to modulate its output. We will test the effect of rTMS induced modulation (cTBS- inhibitory, iTBS-excitatory, sham) of the cerebellar output on PAS induced plasticity in patients with dystonia and healthy control.

We will also assess the acute effect of the rTMS induced modulation of the cerebellar output on the dystonic symptoms and on the performance at a validated sensorimotor adaptation task. This will be done by double blind post-hoc scoring of the dystonia (BFM or TWSTRS) on standardized videorecording and measurement of the performance at the task after each rTMS session (cTBS, iTBS, sham).

NCT04221659,Effects of Neuromodulation on Brain Electric Activity of Parkinson's Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04221659,,UNKNOWN,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative and progressive movement disorder, whose population incidence is increasing. It is characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, stiffness and bradykinesia, and non-motor symptoms, highlighting the executive dysfunction that can be present from the early stages of the disease. These deficits increase the risk of falls and reduce functional independence. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (ETCC) can be an attractive rehabilitation option in PD because it is a non-invasive and safe method that can modulate cortical excitability and improve motor and non-motor symptoms. One of the techniques to detect neurophysiological biomarkers associated with changes in the functional health of the brain and the effectiveness of this type of treatment is the analysis of microstates from the electroencephalogram (EEG). So, the objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of different assemblies of multifocal ETCC on the electrical brain activity represented by the EEG microstates and clinical characteristics in patients with PD.",NO,Parkinson Disease,DEVICE: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,"Change in EEG microstates, For the analysis of the EEG microstates the following temporal parameters will be considered: the average duration of each microstate; its frequency of occurrence; the fraction of the total recording time covered by each; the overall variation explained by each microstate and the probabilities of transition from one microstate to another.

NCT04922411,Cortical Network Modulation by Subthalamic Nucleus DBS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04922411,,RECRUITING,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) can provide substantial motor benefit yet can also produce unwanted mood and cognitive side effects. Although the neural mechanisms underlying benefits and side effects are not well understood, current hypotheses center on the potentially measurable yet currently undefined effects within downstream cortical networks. Limitations of current tools have impeded attempts to assess network connectivity directly and dynamically in humans with implanted DBS; PET lacks the necessary temporal resolution while fMRI is neither optimal nor safe for patients with implanted DBS. In this proposal, to overcome these significant limitations, the investigators apply high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) methods to investigate how STN DBS modulates cortical functional networks and behavior in PD patients. HD-DOT uses a collection of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) measurements, free of radiation exposure concerns, and without electrical/metal artifacts or contraindications or safety concerns for DBS. However, common fNIRS systems are critically hampered by typically sparse measurement distributions that lead to poor anatomical specificity, unreliable image quality due to crosstalk with scalp signals, poor spatial resolution, limited field of view, unstable point spread functions, and uneven spatial coverage. HD-DOT solves these problems by using high-density interlaced source and detector imaging arrays that support densely overlapping measurements and anatomical head models that together result in higher spatial resolution, stable point spread functions, and greatly improved isolation of brain signals from scalp signals. The investigators have demonstrated that HD-DOT accurately maps functional connectivity (FC) within and between cortical resting state networks (RSNs) in the outer \~1cm of cortex with comparable temporal and spatial resolution to fMRI. Preliminary data in older controls and STN DBS patients that directly establish validity and feasibility for the proposed studies are provided.

A recent comprehensive evaluation of FC in PD (without DBS) using fMRI found reduced within-network FC in visual, somatomotor, auditory, thalamic and cerebellar networks and reduced between-network FC involving predominantly cortical RSNs (somatomotor, sensory and association), some of which correlated with cognitive and motor dysfunction in PD. Notably, striatal RSNs were not abnormal. These data suggest that PD affects the interrelationships of cortical networks in a behaviorally meaningful way, far downstream of focal subcortical neuropathology. STN DBS is known to alter activity in downstream cortical regions that function as nodes within these dynamic cortical networks supporting movement and cognition. Thus, cortical network FC may play a critical role in mediating the impact of STN DBS on motor and non-motor behavior. Location of the stimulating contact may further modulate these downstream effects, due to the complex functional organization of the STN region.

Study procedures include motor and cognitive tests, questionnaires, HD-DOT scanning, and MRI scans.

The investigators propose to investigate how STN DBS influences downstream cortical network FC using HD-DOT.

This information could lead to more efficient clinical optimization of DBS, identify potential cortical targets for less invasive neuromodulation, and lay the groundwork for future more complex experimental manipulations to determine the full range of STN DBS-induced cortical network responses to up-stream focal electrical perturbations, revealing fundamental properties of functional network plasticity.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Deep Brain Stimulation,DEVICE: STN DBS,"Functional Connectivity measures, Average correlation values for specific functional networks (Somatomotor, visual, auditory and frontoparietal) obtained from HD-DOT., measures will be fully available at the end of this 5 yr study",,,Washington University School of Medicine,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,100,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,201908154|1R01NS109487-01A1,2021-04-23,2026-04,2026-04,2021-06-10,,2023-03-21,"Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States",

* The brain has natural electrical rhythms of brain activities. These rhythms may be different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle movement, cramps, or tremors). Understanding these rhythms may provide more information about movement disorders.
* Focal hand dystonia, also known as ""writer's cramp"" or ""musician's cramp,"" is a painful condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand dystonia.

Objectives:

- To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand dystonia.
* Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.
* This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to 5 hours.
* Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right and left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger muscles, and see how much TMS is needed.
* In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst. Participants will have multiple bursts during the test. This test will look at how the muscles of the hand and fingers respond to brain stimulation.

NCT05512299,Investigating Cerebellar Inhibition and Its Clinical Significance in Parkinsonian Tremor and Intention Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05512299,,RECRUITING,"Cerebellocerebral connection plays an important function in motor control. Nowadays it can be investigated with neuroimaging and physiological methods in humans. Cerebellar inhibition (CBI) is a phenomenon showing a physiological suppression of the motor evoked potential (MEP) evoked from the motor cortex (M1) by delivering a preceding transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the contralateral cerebellum. Despite the mediated pathway is supposed to be the cerebello-dentato-thalamo-cortical (CDTC) circuit, there is no conclusive evidence. In addition, the clinical significant of CBI remains unclear. Based on our previous studies, we found that the patients with advanced tremor show an impaired Bereitschaftspotential. The findings support a notion that the patients with tremor bear dysfunction of the CDTC circuit. Intriguingly, the pathogenesis of the parkinsonian tremor is highly associated with the CDTC circuit. The ""dimmer-switch"" model suggests that the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit dysfunction may initiate the resting tremor, and the following CDTC circuit dysfunction will lead to the large-amplitude resting and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). The intention tremor is usually found in the patients with cerebellar degeneration, which is also relevant to the CDTC circuit dysfunction. We expect that the clinical significance of CBI and the mediated pathway of CBI will be clarified by this study.",NO,Tremor,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,"Change from baseline cerebellar inhibition (CBI) input output curve, The CBI is recorded with two different TMS coils. The figure-of-eight coil (2X90 mm) is used for the motor cortex stimulation and the double cone coil (2X126 mm) is used for the cerebellar stimulation. The target recording muscle is first dorsal interosseous (FDI). The TMS intensity used to induce an average MEP amplitude of 0.5 mV is also determined. CBI is measured by a paired TMS with an inter-stimulus interval of 6 ms. That is, the test TMS at M1 is delivered 6 ms following the conditional TMS at contralateral cerebellum.

There are five TMS intensities used for the conditional cerebellar stimulation: 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% and 120% inion active motor threshold. Ten trials are recorded for each TMS intensity with a pseudorandomized order.

Researchers would like to use repetitive transcranial stimulation (rTMS) to better understand the roles of individual brain regions on the processes of learning and reasoning. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp, and rapidly turning on and off the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

NCT03026712,Hemiparetic Arm Robotic Mobilization With Non Invasive Electrical Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03026712,hARMonies,COMPLETED,"The two cerebral hemispheres find themselves in a state of balanced mutual inhibition. A stroke with involvement of motor function leads to a reduced excitability in affected hemisphere M1 and to an increased excitability of contralateral M1.

The clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease include the following motor tasks: difficult in initiating movement, performing rhythmic movement or serial movement, the ability of learning motor movement is also affected. The primary treatment for Parkinson's disease is medical treatment; surgery is used if in need. Rehabilitation such as physical therapy, which aims to improve patient's quality of life and functions, is a non-invasive treatment and value for PD patients. Auditory cue is a technique that widely applied on training patients with Parkinson's disease, and some researches revealed that auditory cueing could improve motor performance. However, the mechanism under this treatment technique is still unknown.

This study is to investigate the effect of auditory cueing on rhythmic finger movement in patients with Parkinson's disease. To investigate the mechanism under auditory cueing, neurophysiological data such as motor cortex excitability and blood flow in cortical cortex will be obtained by using Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).",NO,Parkinson's Disease,PROCEDURE: rhythmic auditory stimulation,"Finger Tapping, Record pre-test and post-test change., Baseline,45-60 minutes.|Motor evoked potential, Use single-pulse TMS to assess Motor evoked potential change., Baseline,45-60 minute|Intracortical inhibition & Intracortical facilitation, Use paired-pulse TMS to record pre-test and post-test change., Baseline,45-60 minutes|Blood oxygen dependent level, Use Near-infrared spectroscopy to record pre-test, in experiment, and post-test change., Baseline, in experiment,45-60 minutes",,,Chang Gung University,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,38,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,102-3809A3,2013-08,2014-08,2014-08,2014-01-16,,2014-01-16,"Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, 333, Taiwan",

The oscillatory activity prevails at 8-30 Hz in untreated Parkinson's Disease (PD) and its amplitude at both subthalamic and cortical levels inversely correlates with motor impairment. Moreover, these different levels in BG-cortical loops are coherent in this frequency band. The 8-30 Hz activity is suppressed by treatment following treatment with dopaminergic drugs and is partially suppressed prior to and during voluntary movements. An unanswered question is how do BG-cortical loops become so prominently engaged in this oscillatory activity? One possible explanation is that the resonance frequencies of the loops fall in the 8-30 Hz band in the untreated state, so that oscillations in this band are transmitted particularly well. This hypothesis was confirmed in a previous series of experiments.The aim is to determine whether the resonance frequency within BG-cortical loops is correlated to the BG-cortical coherence frequency (with 20 subjets during 24 months).",NO,Parkinson's Disease|Pathophysiology of Neuronal Oscillations Within Subthalamo-cortical Loops,OTHER: subthalamo-cortical loops stimulation in a one-sided and bipolar way|OTHER: subthalamo-cortical loops stimulation in a one-sided and bipolar way,"the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the propagation of pathological oscillatory activities in PD, 24 months","may provide a basis for different therapeutic strategies, 24 months",,Assistance Publique Hopitaux De Marseille,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,23,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,2009-A00913-54,2012-03-26,2015-05-27,2015-05-27,2011-01-27,,2022-07-29,"APHM, Marseille, 13, France",

The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. TMS is done on eight of the ten test days.
* Repetitive TMS (rTMS): The same procedure as TMS, except repeated magnetic pulses are delivered in short bursts. RTMS is done on eight of the ten test days.
* Theta burst stimulation (TBS): A form of rTMS that involves short bursts of impulses. TBS is done on four study days.
* Cathodal transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS): Two conductive-rubber electrodes placed in saline-soaked sponges are positioned over two areas of the head. A constant weak electrical current flow is applied for 20 minutes. tDCS is done on two study days.

Evaluations

* Physician observation: The subject's eyes are videotaped for 5 minutes before and after each TMS session. A physician then counts how many times the subject blinked during the 5 minutes.
* Questionnaire: Subjects are asked to rate their symptoms before and after brain stimulation.

When repetitious TMS pulses are delivered to a specific target at predefined stimulation parameters, it is referred to as rTMS therapy.The investigators propose a novel approach to investigate the clinical and physiological effects of low frequency rTMS therapy in POT. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that low frequency rTMS therapy delivered to the cerebellum will modulate the cerebellar excitability and result in clinical improvements.In order to determine the physiological effects related to rTMS, the tremor physiology will also be recorded with surface electromyography (EMG). The investigator will also record the changes in cerebellum excitability in response to rTMS using cerebello-cortical inhibition (CBI), a well-established TMS parameter.",NO,Primary Orthostatic Tremor,"DEVICE: Magstim RapidStim2|DEVICE: Sham Magstim RapidStim2|OTHER: Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS)|OTHER: Timed ""Up & Go"" Test (TUG) test|OTHER: 10m walk test|OTHER: Tremor electrophysiology|OTHER: Cerebellar-brain Inhibition (CBI)","Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), Part A assesses examiner-reported tremor location/severity (amplitude), Part B assesses examiner-reported ability to perform specific motor tasks/functions (writing, drawing, and pouring with dominant and non-dominant hand), and Part C assesses patient-reported functional disability resulting from the tremor (speaking, eating, drinking, hygiene, dressing, writing, working, and social activities).All tremor items will be rated based on a scale of 0=none to 4=severe. Finally, the TRS includes one separate item dealing with global assessment of tremor-related disability, rated both by patient and examiner on a 5-point scale.

It is characterized mainly by the presence of tremor, stiffness, bradykinesia and postural instability, leading to progressive functional limitation and impairment in the performance of usual activities of daily living. In addition, patients may have cognitive disorders, memory deficits, problems related to visuospatial dysfunction, difficulties in performing sequential or repetitive movements, freezing, and slow psychological responses. Previous studies analyzed by systematic reviews suggest the efficacy of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) to improve the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD, depending on the area of stimulation. However, most of these focus only on one specific area. Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to investigate the effects of multifocal neuromodulation on the motor and cognitive function of people with Parkinson's disease.",NO,Parkinson Disease,DEVICE: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,"Changes in motor function assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - Part III (UPDRS - III), For this outcome, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - Part III will be used. Section III provides an overall score for movement-related functions and activities (tremor, stiffness, gait, alternating movements, among others). This section is made up of 33 items, which can range from zero (normal) to four (severe), with responses that are linked to commonly accepted clinical terms. The higher the score, the greater the impairment of motor function., Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Changes in cognitive function assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening tool. MoCA is composed of eight cognitive domains, which are scored within a range of 0 to 30 points (higher scores indicate better function): short-term memory; visuospatial skills; executive function; verbal fluency; attention, concentration and working memory; language; sentence repetition; and spatiotemporal orientation., Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)","Changes in attention and mental flexibility assessed by the Trail Making Test - A and B, To assess this outcome, the Trail Making Test - Parts A and B will be used. In condition A, the participant must draw lines, without removing the pencil from the paper, to connect numbers in a sequence. In condition B, the participant must draw lines to connect numbers and letters in an alternating numeric and alphabetic sequence. Prior to the execution of the task, a short ""training sheet"" is presented from both parts, in which the above instructions are given. The final score represents the total time to finish the task execution. When the participant makes a mistake during the test, the examiner should point out the error at the time of the test and ask the examiner to return to the previous circle and continue the test. Thus, errors are not logged, but result in an increase in total time., Baseline, after 6 weeks, and after 10 weeks (follow-up)|Changes in executive functions and planning assessed by the London Tower Task, The Tower of London task is very sensitive to evaluate executive dysfunction in PD patients. The Tower of London is made up of three vertical pins of different heights and three colored spheres, with a hole in the center for the pins to fit. The goal is to move them to reproduce, in a given number of moves, the position of a presented target figure. There are 15 problems with increasing difficulty and reduced possibilities for moving parts. Three attempts to resolve the issue are allowed.

This study will use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), nerve conduction studies, and electroencephaolography (EEG) to look for differences in the way the brain changes with learning in people with Parkinson's disease.

Healthy normal volunteers and people with Parkinson's disease who are between 21 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures in five visits to the NIH Clinical Center:

Visit 1

Medical and neurological examination.

Visit 2

Motor training. Participants perform a pinching movement once every other second, timed to a metronome, during rTMS. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts of impulses.

Visits 3 and 4

Brain physiology studies using rTMS, nerve conduction studies (electrical nerve stimulation) and EEG. A nerve at the subject's wrist is stimulated with electrical impulses to measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle. rTMS is performed for 20 minutes. The EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain (brain waves). For this test, electrodes (metal discs) are placed on the scalp with a conductive gel and the brain waves are recorded while the subject moves his or her thumb briskly for 20 minutes.

Patients with Parkinson's disease often suffer from extremely slow movements (bradykinesia) which result in the inability to perform complex physical acts.

Imaging studies of the brain have provided researchers with information about the specific areas in the brain associated with these motor difficulties. One particular area involved is the surface of the brain called the cerebral cortex.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to stimulate brain activity and gather information about brain function. It is very useful when studying the areas of the brain related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp and rapidly turning on and off the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

Researchers plan to study the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on complex motor behavior of patients with Parkinson's disease.

It is particularly important to study these people because they are a good model for understanding the development of common non-hereditary Parkinson's and dystonia. To do this, the investigators want to look at how the brain works and how different areas of the brain communicate with each other. The investigators want to identify differences in brain regions connecting perception and action between mutation carriers that develop clinical symptoms and those who stay healthy in different subgroups of inherited Parkinson-dystonia syndromes. Mutation carriers with and without symptoms of three different inherited Parkinson-dystonia syndromes will be investigated at their homes with the help of a mobile examination unit. To detect even subtle signs, which the mutation carriers might not even be aware of, the investigators will use a detailed video-based and -documented movement examination and a non-invasive magnetic stimulation technique that investigates how a sensory, i.e., electrical stimulus can influence the motor response in a hand muscle. Our study will allow the investigators, on the one hand, to define specific markers that protect some mutation carriers from having clinical symptoms and, on the other hand, to identify neurophysiological characteristics that all mutation carriers share whether or not they have clinical symptoms. These are important information for a better understanding of the basis of these disorders and for the development of new treatment strategies, which can also be transferred to genetically-undefined Parkinson's and dystonia syndromes.

Early CP diagnosis and intervention are crucial to improving outcomes in these patients. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has become a standard therapeutic intervention for children with unilateral CP. CIMT utilizes restraining of the unaffected upper limb to stimulate the use of the paretic upper limb enhancing neuroplasticity in the affected cerebral hemisphere.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe non-invasive technique that stimulates the brain using repetitive magnetic pulses to enhance neuroplasticity. TMS has been shown to improve symptoms of children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as CP. It is predicted that a combined therapy that uses CIMT and TMS is could improve mobility in children with unilateral CP.

To determine if combined therapy is beneficial to children with CP and if use of this therapy is feasible for families, the investigators would like to conducted a feasibility trial.

It has been proposed as a treatment for brain disorders, including Parkinson's disease. In preliminary studies, some patients' symptoms improved; in some they worsened temporarily, and some showed no change.

Patients between 40 and 80 years of age with moderately severe Parkinson's disease, whose main problem is slowness of movement and stiffness, may be eligible for this study.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: one will receive rTMS to parts of the brain involved in controlling movement; the other will receive sham, or placebo, stimulation. Nine treatments will be given over a 4-1/2 week period. Patients will take their Parkinson's disease medications during the study, but will stop taking the medicines for 4 to 5 hours before one of the sessions.

For rTMS, an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The pulses are delivered in trains, or short bursts, lasting 1 second each. There will be 48 trains for a total of 1200 pulses per 24-minute session. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching in the scalp or face and may also cause small movements of the limbs.

NCT02503930,The Effect of tDCS on a Motor-cognitive Dual-task Performance of Parkinson's Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02503930,,UNKNOWN,"The concurrent performance of two tasks, i.e., dual tasking (DT), is a common and ubiquitous every day phenomena. For example, people frequently walk while talking on a cellphone or drive while talking to a passenger. Often, the performance of one or more of these simultaneously performed tasks may deteriorate when another task is carried out at the same time, even in healthy young adults. This reduction in performance is referred to as the DT deficit or DT cost and is typically much higher in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in young adults or age-matched controls. In PD, this DT cost impairs the gait pattern, as manifested, for example, in increased gait variability, exacerbating instability and fall risk.

NCT01964261,Sensory Motor Transformations in Human Cortex,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01964261,,RECRUITING,"This research study is being conducted to develop a brain controlled medical device, called a brain-machine interface. The device will provide people with a spinal cord injury some ability to control an external device such as a computer cursor or robotic limb by using their thoughts along with sensory feedback.

Development of a brain-machine interface is very difficult and currently only limited technology exists in this area of neuroscience. Other studies have shown that people with high spinal cord injury still have intact brain areas capable of planning movements and grasps, but are not able to execute the movement plans. The device in this study involves implanting very fine recording electrodes into areas of the brain that are known to create arm movement plans and provide hand grasping information and sense feeling in the hand and fingers. These movement and grasp plans would then normally be sent to other regions of the brain to execute the actual movements. By tying into those pathways and sending the movement plan signals to a computer instead, the investigators can translate the movement plans into actual movements by a computer cursor or robotic limb.

A key part of this study is to electrically stimulate the brain by introducing a small amount of electrical current into the electrodes in the sensory area of the brain. This will result in the sensation of touch in the hand and/or fingers. This stimulation to the brain will occur when the robotic limb touches the object, thereby allowing the brain to ""feel"" what the robotic arm is touching.

The device being used in this study is called the Neuroport Array and is surgically implanted in the brain. This device and the implantation procedure are experimental which means that it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). One Neuroport Array consists of a small grid of electrodes that will be implanted in brain tissue and a small cable that runs from the electrode grid to a small hourglass-shaped pedestal. This pedestal is designed to be attached to the skull and protrude through the scalp to allow for connection with the computer equipment. The top portion of the pedestal has a protective cover that will be in place when the pedestal is not in use. The top of this pedestal and its protective cover will be visible on the outside of the head. Three Neuroport Arrays and pedestals will be implanted in this study so three of these protective covers will be visible outside of the head. It will be possible to cover these exposed portions of the device with a hat or scarf.

Currently, treatment measures for patients with Parkinson's disease with depression are mainly limited to pharmacotherapy, but the side effects of antidepressants and their interaction with anti-Parkinsonian drugs limit the use of pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new painless and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that is commonly used in the treatment of depression. As the number of people with Parkinson's disease increases in China, the number of patients with Parkinson's disease and depression requiring rTMS treatment will also increase. The size and shape of individual brains, the distance between the stimulation coil and the responding neuronal tissue, and the location and orientation of anatomical structures are all different, and the use of common localization methods is usually limited by these individual anatomical differences. The traditional method relies on manual positioning of the coil, which is time-consuming and inefficient, and it is difficult to meet the requirements of position, angle, and coil orientation simultaneously. Studies have shown that the benefits of using navigation for rTMS treatment are up to twice as high as those of non-navigation methods. Therefore precise localization is a must for the future standardized application of rTMS in the development of patients with Parkinson's disease with depression. In this study, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with neuronavigation to treat patients with Parkinson's disease and depression, and reconstructed cephalometric models with individual cranial imaging data to individualize and precisely target stimulation sites, making rTMS more precise and effective in treating patients with Parkinson's disease and depression, and providing new avenues for further clinical and scientific research.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Depression|Cognitive Impairment,DEVICE: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS),"Hamilton Depression Scale（HAMD）, The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) is a 24-item interviewer administered structure questionaire designed to assess symptoms of depression.

NCT01189058,Modulation of Brain Plasticity After Perinatal Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01189058,PLASTIC CHAMPS,UNKNOWN,"Newborn stroke is the leading cause of a common type of cerebral palsy (CP) that affects thousands of Canadian children and families. Treatments for CP are generally ineffective, and have traditionally focused on the weak body rather than the injured brain. Understanding how the newborn brain responds to injuries like stroke (plasticity) carries the greatest potential for better treatments. We propose to study the ability of two interventions to modulate brain plasticity toward better function in children with stroke-induced CP. One is a rehabilitation method called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), the other is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is safe and comfortable for children and we recently showed it could improve motor function in children with stroke.

We will perform a special study to test both treatments simultaneously. Children 7-18 years with stroke-induced CP will be recruited into the study from across Alberta. Each child will randomly receive either TMS, CIMT, both, or neither each day for two weeks while attending our new HemiKids Power Camp for motor learning. Improvements will be measured by trained therapists over 1 year. TMS will also measure brain plasticity, both initially and following treatment. Our lead investigator is an expert in both newborn stroke and TMS and has assembled an experienced team of accomplished collaborators to ensure the completion of this important work. This will be the largest study of children with CP examined in this manner. This will be the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) in CP, the largest trial of CIMT (and the first exclusive to newborn stroke), and the first study allowing the direct comparison of two different therapies. In establishing the first dedicated pediatric TMS laboratory in Canada, we will be the first to measure plasticity changes in newborn stroke, advancing new treatments of this previously untreatable and disabling disease.

Normal volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease (stage I to III) 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.

All participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil. This creates a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain and generates very small electrical currents in the cortex, briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. This may cause muscle twitching or tingling in the face, jaw or limb. During the stimulation, participants will be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscle will be recorded on a computer through electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. In most cases, the study will last less than 3 hours.

It is the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation or rTMS) delivered to excite the undamaged hemisphere (specifically the contralesional higher motor cortices or cHMC) in stroke. Therefore, this study will determine whether the positive results obtained in our short-term pilot study can be made to last longer and produce functional benefits in severe patients with the application of brain stimulation in combination with long-term rehabilitation therapy. Rehabilitation therapy administered is called contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES). Determining whether combining rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces synergistic gains in functional abilities in severe patients is necessary for acceptance by the clinical community and to move this technology toward commercialization and widespread dissemination. The proposed study will determine whether the combination of rTMS facilitating the cHMC with CCFES produces greater improvements in upper extremity function in severe participants who are ≥6 months from stroke onset than the combination of rTMS facilitating the damaged hemisphere (specifically the ipsilesional primary motor cortex, iM1) and CCFES or the combination of sham rTMS and CCFES.

NCT06214377,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Treating Parkinson´s Disease-related Pain in OFF State,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06214377,,RECRUITING,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Pain is a significant symptom in PD, affecting a large percentage of patients and impacting their quality of life. The mechanisms of pain in PD involve complex changes in pain-modulating pathways, including dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic systems.

To address the lack of pain management strategies, the investigators propose exploring non-pharmacological therapies like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a safe and non-invasive technique that modulates neuronal activity. It has shown positive effects on pain processing in healthy individuals and chronic pain patients, but its potential for PD-associated pain remains largely unexplored.

The primary motor cortex (M1) is a target for tDCS as it is believed to influence pain processing in other brain regions involved in sensory and emotional aspects. Initial studies suggest the benefits of tDCS in PD, including enhanced motor potentials and potential modulation of dopaminergic pathways. However, there are currently no published studies specifically investigating the effects of tDCS on PD-related pain, highlighting the need for further research.

A proof-of-concept trial is proposed to examine the effects of a single tDCS session on M1 in PD patients during the OFF state (without medication) and after taking dopaminergic medication. The study aims to assess the pain-relieving effects of tDCS in PD and explore potential synergies between tDCS and dopaminergic medication. By better understanding the impact of tDCS on pain relief in PD, this research may offer insights into alternative non-pharmacological approaches for managing pain in PD.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Pain,DEVICE: Active Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|DEVICE: Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|DRUG: Dopaminergic medication,"Change in Conditioned Pain Modulation, Assesses the descending pain modulatory system.

NCT00047957,Brain Inhibition of Muscle Movement in Normal Volunteers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00047957,,COMPLETED,"This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS (described below), to examine how the brain controls muscle movement to prevent unwanted movements in surrounding muscles. For example, when a person moves a finger, a part of the brain called the cortex prevents unwanted movements in other fingers by a process called cortical inhibition. In people with the muscle disorder dystonia, cortical inhibition does not work properly and patients suffer from uncontrolled and sometimes painful movements. A better understanding of how this process works in normal people may shed light on what goes wrong in dystonia and how the condition can be treated.

Healthy normal volunteers 19 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical and neurological examinations. People with a current medical or surgical condition or neurological or psychiatric illness may not participate, nor may individuals who are taking medication that may influence nervous system function.

Participants will undergo TMS to record the electrical activity of muscles in the hand and arm that are activated by magnetic stimulation. For the procedure, subjects are seated in a chair with their hands placed on a pillow in their laps. A wire coil in placed on their scalps. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Subjects will be asked to move their second finger in response to a loud beep or visual cue. In some trials, a brief, mild electrical shock will also be applied to the end of either the second or fifth finger. The shock is not painful.

TMS may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the brain that controls movement, or it may induce twitches or temporary tingling in the forearm, head, or face muscles.

Normally, when a person moves a finger, the brain's motor cortex prevents the other fingers from moving involuntarily. Patients with focal hand dystonia have difficulty with individualized finger movements, possibly due to increased excitability of the motor cortex. Musicians, writers, typists, athletes and others whose work involves frequent repetitive movements may develop focal dystonia of the hand.

Healthy normal volunteers and patients with focal dystonia 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.

For the TMS procedure, subjects are seated in a comfortable chair with their hands placed on a pillow on their lap. An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. This may cause muscle, hand or arm twitching if the coil is near the part of the brain that controls movement, or it may induce twitches or transient tingling in the forearm, head or face muscles. Subjects will be asked to move a finger. Just before this movement, a brief electrical stimulation will be applied to the end of either the second or fifth finger.

NCT05095740,Effects of Neuromodulation in Laryngeal Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05095740,,RECRUITING,"Laryngeal dystonia (LD) causes excessive vocal fold abduction (opening) or adduction (closing) leading to decreased voice quality, job prospects, self-worth and quality of life. Individuals with LD often experience episodic breathy voice, decreased ability to sustain vocal fold vibration, frequent pitch breaks and in some cases, vocal tremor. While neuroimaging investigations have uncovered both cortical organization and regional connectivity differences in structures in parietal, primary somatosensory and premotor cortices of those with LD, there remains a lack of understanding regarding how the brains of those with LD function to produce phonation and how these might differ from those without LD. Intervention options for people with LD are limited to general voice therapy techniques and Botulinum Toxin (Botox) injections to the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) and/or TA (thyroarytenoid) often bilaterally, to alleviate muscle spasms in the vocal folds. However, the effects of injections are short-lived, uncomfortable, and variable. To address this gap, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, in assessing cortical excitability and inhibition of laryngeal musculature. Previous work conducted by the investigator has demonstrated decreased intracortical inhibition in those with adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) compared to healthy controls. The investigators anticipate similar findings in individuals with with other forms of LD, where decreased cortical inhibition will likely be noted in the laryngeal motor cortex. Further, following low frequency (inhibitory) rTMS to the laryngeal motor brain area, it is anticipated that there will be a decrease in overactivation of the TA muscle. To test this hypothesis, a proof-of-concept, randomized study to down-regulate cortical motor signal to laryngeal muscles will be compared to those receiving an equal dose of sham rTMS.
