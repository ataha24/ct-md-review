NCT01019343,Physiological Investigations of Movement Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01019343,,COMPLETED,"Background:

* Previous studies have given researchers information on how the brain controls movement, how people learn to make fine, skilled movements, and why some people have movement disorders. However, further research is needed to learn more about the causes of most movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.
* By using small, specialized studies to evaluate people with movement disorders and compare them with healthy volunteers, researchers hope to learn more about the changes in the brain and possible causes of movement disorders.

Objectives:

* To better understand how the brain controls movement.
* To learn more about movement disorders.
* To train movement disorder specialists.

Eligibility:

* Individuals 18 years of age or older who have had a movement disorder diagnosed by a neurologist and are able to participate based on the specific requirements of the small study.
* Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older.

Design:

* Participants will have a screening visit with medical history, physical examination, and questionnaire to determine eligibility. Eligible participants will give consent to participate in up to seven additional outpatient visits for study procedures. The number of sessions and the procedures needed for participation depend on specific symptoms.
* Participants must avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated drinks (sodas, coffee, and tea) for at least 2 days (48 hours) before each session.
* Potential studies may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, functional MRI scans, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, nerve and sensory stimulation, or movement and mental tasks during any of the above procedures.

This study is designed as a prospective, single site, single arm, nonrandomized study. Assessments will be made before and three months after MRgFUS for clinical symptom relief, quality of life (QoL) improvements, and safety of MRgFUS in the treatment of ET. Similarly, QoL measures will be obtained using Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST) questionnaire. Relative Safety will be evaluated using a common description of Significant Clinical Complications for patients treated in this study. This study will be performed on the 3T MR scanners.

The ExAblate system is a medical device that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI scanner. ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the targeted tissue. In this particular study the targeted tissue is a unilateral thermal lesion created in the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.

The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location and shape of tumor to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called ""sonications"". These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress, and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.

The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing 1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head. The ExAblate transcranial system also includes means to immobilize the subject head, cool the interface water, and software for CT analysis and phase correction computation.

NCT05512299,Investigating Cerebellar Inhibition and Its Clinical Significance in Parkinsonian Tremor and Intention Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05512299,,RECRUITING,"Cerebellocerebral connection plays an important function in motor control. Nowadays it can be investigated with neuroimaging and physiological methods in humans. Cerebellar inhibition (CBI) is a phenomenon showing a physiological suppression of the motor evoked potential (MEP) evoked from the motor cortex (M1) by delivering a preceding transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the contralateral cerebellum. Despite the mediated pathway is supposed to be the cerebello-dentato-thalamo-cortical (CDTC) circuit, there is no conclusive evidence. In addition, the clinical significant of CBI remains unclear. Based on our previous studies, we found that the patients with advanced tremor show an impaired Bereitschaftspotential. The findings support a notion that the patients with tremor bear dysfunction of the CDTC circuit. Intriguingly, the pathogenesis of the parkinsonian tremor is highly associated with the CDTC circuit. The ""dimmer-switch"" model suggests that the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit dysfunction may initiate the resting tremor, and the following CDTC circuit dysfunction will lead to the large-amplitude resting and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). The intention tremor is usually found in the patients with cerebellar degeneration, which is also relevant to the CDTC circuit dysfunction.

The figure-of-eight coil (2X90 mm) is used for the motor cortex stimulation and the double cone coil (2X126 mm) is used for the cerebellar stimulation. The target recording muscle is first dorsal interosseous (FDI). The TMS intensity used to induce an average MEP amplitude of 0.5 mV is also determined. CBI is measured by a paired TMS with an inter-stimulus interval of 6 ms. That is, the test TMS at M1 is delivered 6 ms following the conditional TMS at contralateral cerebellum.

NCT04074031,Transcranial Ultrasound Therapy of Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04074031,ULTRABRAINTher,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Context. Essential tremor (ET) is a common disease, disabling in severe forms and resistant to drug treatment. In patients with severe ET, invasive neurosurgical technique such as deep brain stimulation of the Ventral Intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus is used. Focused ultrasound therapy, creating a small lesion of VIM represents an effective therapeutic alternative of low morbidity with the advantage of not requiring the opening of the skull and penetration into the brain. This therapy is performed under stereotactic guidance. Validation of the target before lesioning is done by testing the clinical effect by a gradual increase in temperature, resulting in tremor reduction. However, the gradual temperature increase in the targeting phase is suboptimal because it can decrease the efficiency of the lesioning procedure. The aim of this research project is to test an innovation of fundamental physics developed by the Langevin Institute, which would allow the reversible modulation of nerve tissue by ultrasonic waves without heating, to predict the effectiveness of treatment of the chosen target within the VIM before creating an irreversible lesion.

Methodology: Fifteen patients with severe and resistant essential tremor will be included in the study. A multimodal MRI will be performed for target calculation using several targeting methods for VIM developed during step 1. For each target, the application of neuro-modulation by ultrasound will allow determine the effect obtained on the tremor (quantified with adequate clinical scales - as Tremor rating scale (CRST), and the recording of electromyographic activity of the upper limbs) and the absence of side effects. A definitive millimetric lesion will be performed at the level of the most relevant target in order to maintain the clinical effect obtained. The procedure will be controlled by thermal MRI sequences. Post-therapy clinical and MRI multimodal follow-up will take place on D1, D7, M1, M2, M3, M6, M12 and M24.

Perspectives and Innovation: This project will test clinically the low intensity ultrasound neuromodulation jointly developed by the Langevin Institute and the Brain and Spine Institute ( ICM) in order to refine the targeting procedure of high intensity transcranial focused ultrasound therapy. In perspective, reversible neuromodulation performed in vivo in humans represents a considerable advance in the exploration and future treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases such as depression.

NCT05008094,The Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease in Croatia and the Influence of Genetic Factors and Microbiota on the Progression and Treatment Outcomes of the Disease (GiOPARK),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05008094,GiOPARK,UNKNOWN,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, which affects 2-3% of the general population above 65 years. There are significant differences in incidence depending on geographical location, race, and ethnicity. The exact cause of the disease is still unknown, but the role of genetic and environmental factors has already been established. Certain genetic forms of the disease make up for a small percentage, so it is thought that environmental factors have a more significant impact on the development of the disease. The incidence of PD is higher in people exposed to significant quantities of pesticides and traumatic brain injury, while there is a smaller incidence in smokers and people consuming more significant quantities of caffeine. The project will finish in four years, with the first 20 months dedicated to the first phase (genetic-epidemiological research), and the entirety of the 48 months for the second phase of the project (prospective clinical research).

The main goal of the first phase of the project is to determine which genetic mutations are the ones most represented in the Croatian population afflicted with the familial form of PD. In the second phase the main goal is to determine the influence of genetic factors and microbiological factors on the disease's progression as well as on the treatment outcomes. Specific goals of this part of the project are to determine how many patients in the general population of PD patients present with a genetic disorder and which genes have a role in that disorder, as well as determine the composition of intestinal and oral microbiota both in the patient test group and the healthy control group. Furthermore, specific goals are to evaluate the effects of standard PD treatment on the composition of microbiota, neurodegeneration progression and the activity of neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and to examine whether there is a link between the physiological and the pathophysiological function of microbiota, using markers of disease progression and glial activity. Last specific goal is to analyze potential pathological conformation protein forms that could be used as a biomarker in early stages of the disease and a biomarker of disease progression.

The first phase of the study will provide the first epidemiologic data on the familial form of PD, as well as the mutations most represented in patients with PD in Croatia. Additionally, the prospective clinical study will contribute to enlightening the intertwined effects of genetic and environmental factors in the emergence and progression of the disease, as well as their effect on treatment outcome. Intestinal and oral microbiota composition analysis will determine whether there is a difference between PD and the healthy population while using the short-chain fatty acid profile will determine the metabolic differences between the two groups. Analyzing the markers of CNS homeostasis, inflammation, and neuroglial function will determine the progression of the disease and also correlate them to genetic factors as well as the microbiota function and composition.

The ExAblate system is a medical device that involves a focused ultrasound system and an MRI scanner. ExAblate delivers a pulse of focused ultrasound energy, or sonication, to the targeted tissue. In this particular study the targeted tissue is a unilateral thermal lesion created in the ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus.

The treatment begins with a series of standard diagnostic MR images to identify the location and shape of tumor to be treated. The ExAblate computer uses the physician's designation of the target volume to plan the best way to cover the target volume with small spots called ""sonications"". These treatment spots are cylinder shaped. Their size depends on sonication power and duration. During the treatment, a specific MR scan, which can be processed to identify changes in tissue temperature, provides a thermal map of the treatment volume to confirm the therapeutic effect. The thermal map is used to monitor the treatment in progress, and confirm that the ablation is proceeding according to plan, thus closing the therapy loop.

The ExAblate transcranial operates a helmet-shaped transducer (currently utilizing 1000-element phased array transducer) positioned above the subject head.
