NCT06121947,Safety and Efficacy Study of Implantable Neuromodulation for Poststroke Hemiplegia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06121947,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Background: Hemiplegia is a common complication after a stroke. Studies have shown that traditional medical and rehabilitation treatments are not good for improving patients' motor function, deep brain stimulation (DBS) and vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can improve the motor function of patients, but there is no comparative study between them. Objectives: This study compares the efficacy and safety of DBS and VNS in the recovery of motor function in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, determining the best treatment for patients with post-stroke hemiplegia, and providing high-level clinical evidence for patients and clinicians to choose from. Methods/Design: This is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-controlled pilot study. A total of 98 patients with post-stroke hemiplegia are assigned to receive DBS or VNS. After 3 and 6 months of follow-up, all the devices are turned off. After a 2-week washout, the control group is turned on, but the stimulation group is given sham stimulation. After 9 and 12 months of follow-up, all the devices are turned on. Then, at postoperative 15 and 18 months, postoperative neuroimaging and various post-stroke motor-related scores were performed for data collection and analysis. Discussion: We propose a study design and rationale to compare the efficacy and safety of DBS and VNS in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia to provide evidence and reference for implantable neuromodulation in the treatment of post-stroke dysfunction, and to compare the therapeutic effects of DBS and VNS to provide evidence for patient and clinical diagnosis and treatment choices.

NCT03120325,Vagal Nerve Stimulation for Gastroparesis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03120325,VNS,TERMINATED,"This study is investigating a new form of treatment for a digestive disorder called gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is thought to be caused by a mix of inflammation and neural dysfunction. The vagal nerve is a large nerve originating from the brain that regulates digestive function. Patients with gastroparesis have what is a called a low vagal tone which results in gastrointestinal motility problems and inflammation; therefore, investigators hypothesize that increasing vagal tone through a hand-held vagal nerve simulator will reduce inflammation and gastrointestinal motility problems in gastroparesis patients. Investigators will evaluate this hypothesis through the use of upper endoscopy testing, breath testing, and blood, stool, urine, heart rate variability, and saliva testing before and after 4 weeks of vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) treatment.

There are 6 research visits

Visit 1 and visit 2 may take up to 8 weeks (screening/baseline) Visit 3 and visit 4 will take 4 weeks (VNS treatment) visit 5 and 6 will take approximately 4 weeks (VNS followup/washout)

Consequently, it is possible that if a patient were to be at the farthest ends of visit windows, they could potentially be in the study for approx 16 weeks. Visit 1 and 2 may be less than 8 weeks which would shorten the patient's overall involvement in the study.

This scale, widely used in the clinical and research settings, helps us evaluate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.

The MDS-UPDRS Part III scale ranges from 0 to 132, with 0 representing no motor symptoms and 132 representing severe motor symptoms. Therefore, a higher score on the MDS-UPDRS Part III scale indicates a worse outcome, reflecting more severe motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease., 8 weeks|6MWT, 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT): We utilize the 6-Minute Walk Test in our study to evaluate the functional exercise capacity of our participants. The 6MWT involves participants walking as far as they can in a span of six minutes on a flat, hard surface. The total distance covered in six minutes is recorded as the score. In this test, a greater distance indicates better physical endurance and mobility. Therefore, in our study, a higher score (greater distance walked) on the 6MWT represents a better outcome, signifying superior functional exercise capacity., 8 weeks|10MWT, The 10MWT is a timed walking test commonly used in clinical and research settings to assess an individual's gait speed and functional mobility. It measures the time it takes for a person to walk a distance of 10 meters (approximately 33 feet). The scale title, in this case, is the time in seconds or minutes required to complete the 10-meter walk. There are no specific minimum and maximum values for this measure since it depends on the individual's walking ability. However, lower scores (i.e., shorter times) generally indicate better outcomes, as they reflect faster gait speed and improved mobility. Conversely, higher scores (longer times) would suggest slower walking speed and potentially poorer functional mobility., 8 weeks|Mini-Best Test, The Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest) is a clinical assessment tool used to evaluate a person's balance and stability. It consists of 14 items that assess different aspects of balance, including anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, dynamic gait, and stability during functional tasks. The scale title for the Mini-BESTest is the total score, which ranges from 0 to 28. Higher scores on the Mini-BESTest indicate better balance performance and greater overall stability. A score of 28 represents the best possible outcome, indicating excellent balance abilities across all assessed domains. Conversely, lower scores indicate poorer balance control and increased risk of falls., 8 weeks|FGA, The Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) is a clinical measure used to assess an individual's walking ability and functional mobility. It evaluates various aspects of gait, including balance, coordination, range of motion, and adaptability. The FGA consists of 10 different tasks or conditions that challenge the person's walking abilities in different ways, such as walking while turning, walking over obstacles, or walking with eyes closed. The scale title for the FGA is the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores on the FGA indicate better functional gait performance and greater walking independence. A score of 30 represents the best possible outcome, reflecting excellent gait function across all assessed conditions. Conversely, lower scores suggest impaired gait function and reduced functional mobility., 8 weeks|mCTSIB, The modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB) is a diagnostic tool used to evaluate an individual's sensory integration and balance control. It assesses the person's ability to maintain balance under various sensory conditions. The mCTSIB involves four different standing positions, each with different sensory inputs: (1) feet together on a firm surface with eyes open, (2) feet together on a firm surface with eyes closed, (3) feet together on a foam surface with eyes open, and (4) feet together on a foam surface with eyes closed. The scale title for the mCTSIB is the overall balance score, typically ranging from 0 to 24. Higher scores on the mCTSIB indicate better balance control and greater sensory integration. A score of 24 represents the best possible outcome, indicating excellent balance performance across all tested conditions. Conversely, lower scores suggest impaired balance control and decreased sensory integration abilities., 8 weeks","MoCA, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely accepted tool in both clinical and research settings, allowing us to evaluate cognitive abilities, specifically focusing on attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation.

The MoCA scale ranges from 0 to 30, with a score of 30 indicating the highest level of cognitive function. Lower scores on the MoCA suggest a higher level of cognitive impairment. Therefore, in the context of our study, a higher score on the MoCA represents a better outcome, signifying superior cognitive performance., 8 weeks|DKEFS Color Word Interference Test, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Color Word Interference Test is used to assess cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control.

It involves three learning trials where a list of 12 words is presented, followed by recall. After a delay, a recognition trial is conducted with 24 words, including the original 12 and distractors. Scale titles include Total Recall (total words recalled), Delayed Recall (words recalled after a delay), and Recognition Discrimination (identifying learned words). Higher scores indicate better verbal learning, memory, and recognition abilities., 8 weeks|DST, Measure of cognitive function, 8 weeks|DSST, The Digit Span Test (DST) is a neuropsychological assessment tool used to evaluate an individual's working memory and attention span. It measures the person's ability to temporarily hold and manipulate a series of digits in their memory. The DST typically consists of two components: forward digit span and backward digit span. In the forward digit span, the examiner reads a series of digits aloud, and the individual is required to repeat them back in the same order. In the backward digit span, the individual is asked to recall the digits in reverse order. The scale title for the DST is the maximum digit span achieved in each component (forward and backward). The minimum value for both components is typically two, as the test starts with a two-digit sequence, and the maximum value varies depending on the test version and administration protocol. Higher digit spans indicate better working memory capacity and attentional abilities., 8 weeks|N-back, The N-back task assesses working memory and attention. Participants match current stimuli with those presented ""N"" steps back. Higher ""N"" values increase task difficulty. Performance is measured by accuracy and reaction time.
