    <Intervention>This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a follow up of 3 months. The interventions, Medido versus usual care, are randomly assigned to the patients and will be stratified by hospital (MST and ZGT). Measurements will take place at baseline, and after three months. At the end of the study it will be determined if there is a significant difference in ALDS between the two groups of patients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Medido is a medication dispenser with a CE characteristic and is used to make medication intake easier for patients. Patients are reminded to intake their medication, including non-Parkinson medication,  by means of sound and light signals. Patients have to press a button to make the Medido dispense the next baxtered medication. Also the baxtered medication bag will be automatically opened by the Medido. If it is not possible to Baxter a specific medication (e.g. inhaled medication), the medication has to be taken apart from the Baxter. For half tablets a solution will be found; possibly a capsule will be used. Changes in medication use during the study are passed on to the pharmacist, which is regular care. Subsequently, the baxtered medication can be changed. When is it needed, the time of intake can also be changed. This can be done remotely. &lt;br&gt;Patient take home the Medido and the pharmacist will fill the Medido at the patients home. Every pharmacist can fill the Medido. Depending upon the amount of medication, this can be done for a maximum of two weeks. The pharmacist calls the company that controls the Medido (Innospense) to upload the specific week schedule for the patient. &lt;br&gt;Thereafter, the patient can use the device and the patient will be reminded to take the medication. When this does not happen, a signal is sent to the call centre o

    <Primary_outcome>The primary parameter of this study is the physical disability of Parkinsonâ€™s patients. To measure the physical disability, the AMC Linear Disability Score (ALDS) will be used. The ALDS checks the activities in daily life of the patient. The ALDS is a flexible, validated and clinimetrically sound and flexible instrument to assess the level of disability in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. 
    </Primary_outcome>
    <Secondary_outcome>1. Does the use of Medido improve the Quality of life of Parkinsonâ€™s patients compared with the current method of medication distribution to Parkinsonâ€™s patients after a follow-up period of 3 months, as measured by the PDQ39 questionnaire;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. What is the cost effectiveness ratio expressed in Cost per QALY of the Medido for Parkinsonâ€™s patients relative to current treatment for Parkinsonâ€™s patients, as measured by the Euroqol  5D (EQ5D);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. What is the Quality of life for personal care givers for Parkinsonâ€™s patients for care givers in the Medido group versus regular care group, as measured by the PDQ carer questionnaire;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;4. What is the patient experience of motor symptoms in the Medido group versus regular care group, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS);&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;5. How many times do you have a off-period during the day, as measured by the MDS-UPDRS.
