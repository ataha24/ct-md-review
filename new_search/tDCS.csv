NCT03216837,Stimulation for Perinatal Stroke Optimizing Recovery Trajectories,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03216837,SPORT,UNKNOWN,"Perinatal stroke causes lifelong neurological disability and most hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP). With morbidity spanning diverse aspects of a child's life and lasting for decades, global impact is large, including 10000 Canadian children. With pathophysiology poorly understood and prevention strategies non-existent, the burden of hemiparetic CP will persist. Limited treatments lead to loss of hope for children and families, necessitating exploration of new therapies. The investigators have evidence that the investigators have a durable new treatment for perinatal stroke, combining non-invasive neurostimulation and child-centred intensive rehabilitation. Via the CHILD-BRIGHT SPOR national network, the investigators will execute a multicentre trial to prove this treatment can improve function in children with perinatal stroke and hemiparetic CP. Using novel advanced technologies not available elsewhere in the world, the investigators will explore how developmental plasticity determines function and response to neuromodulation therapy.

However, further research is needed to learn more about the causes of most movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease.
* By using small, specialized studies to evaluate people with movement disorders and compare them with healthy volunteers, researchers hope to learn more about the changes in the brain and possible causes of movement disorders.

Objectives:

* To better understand how the brain controls movement.
* To learn more about movement disorders.
* To train movement disorder specialists.

Eligibility:

* Individuals 18 years of age or older who have had a movement disorder diagnosed by a neurologist and are able to participate based on the specific requirements of the small study.
* Healthy volunteers 18 years of age or older.

Design:

* Participants will have a screening visit with medical history, physical examination, and questionnaire to determine eligibility. Eligible participants will give consent to participate in up to seven additional outpatient visits for study procedures. The number of sessions and the procedures needed for participation depend on specific symptoms.
* Participants must avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated drinks (sodas, coffee, and tea) for at least 2 days (48 hours) before each session.
* Potential studies may include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, functional MRI scans, electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, transcranial magnetic stimulation, nerve and sensory stimulation, or movement and mental tasks during any of the above procedures.
* This study does not provide treatment for movement disorders. Participants will not have to stop any treatment in order to participate.",NO,Parkinson's Disease|Tourette's Syndrome|Tic Disorders|Dystonia|Movement Disorders,"PROCEDURE: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)|DEVICE: Eye-tracking Device|DEVICE: Pulsed vibrator|OTHER: Gait Trainer Treadmill (GTT)|OTHER: Standard psychiatric scales SCID-I, YBOCS and SCI-OBS-lifetime and cognitive scales MMSE and MOCA|DEVICE: iMobility|DEVICE: QMAT|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Treadmill Test|DEVICE: Arm Intellistretch Device|PROCEDURE: Transcranial Sonography (TCS)|OTHER: Behavioral tasks|PROCEDURE: TMS single/paired pulse|PROCEDURE: MEG|PROCEDURE: EEG|PROCEDURE: MRI techniques|PROCEDURE: Peripheral Nerve Stimulation|PROCEDURE: EMG|PROCEDURE: Trancutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS)","MRI, analyze measures such as the amplitude of the BOLD signal (fMRI); tractography between seed and target regions of interest (using DTI); morphometry of brain regions (using VBM); and different neurotransmitter levels in brain regions of interest (using MRS)., throughout|EEG and MEG, quantify measures such as event- or task-related potentials, synchronization/desynchronization, and coherence between sensors or sources located close to the brain areas of interest., throughout|TMS, analyze measures such as MEP amplitude and central conduction time., throughout|Behavioral measures, quantify measures such as reaction times to initiate movements, EMG patterns, movement kinematics (position, velocity, acceleration, curvature), eye movement., throughout",,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,1273,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE,100009|10-N-0009,2009-12-08,2016-08-17,2020-10-09,2009-11-25,,2024-01-22,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disease of the nervous system that affects movement, produced by the destruction of dopaminergic neurons found in a region of the brain called the basal ganglia Over time, different strategies have been developed to treat and slow the progress of the disease, including pharmacological, rehabilitative and even surgical treatments.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a brain stimulation technique that delivers a low-intensity electrical current to the scalp, usually between 1 and 2 mA over approximately 5 to 30 minutes. The tDCS technique is used with the aim of enhancing a specific brain activity through the neuromodulation of neuronal excitability. In pathologies such as PD, these therapies have been shown to induce immediate after-effects in the brain that translate into reduced gait freezing and improvements in executive function and mobility. In addition, the combined effects of tDCS and physical therapy on the walking ability of PD patients have been studied, where it was shown that anodic tDCS and physiotherapy could be used as a combination treatment to improve patients' gait speed.

Another potential therapeutic tool in the treatment of PD consists of the use of sound stimulation with beat frequencies similar to the step. Specifically, this technology is characterized by presenting two tones of different frequencies for each ear in order to influence the mood and mental performance of the listener.

NCT04509349,Alternating Current Stimulation for Essential Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04509349,,UNKNOWN,"Movement disorders are common neurological disorders, characterized by either excess or paucity of movements. Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common of these disorders, defined as chronic, rhythmic involuntary movements (tremor) that occur primarily during action involving the upper extremities as prominent body site. ET occurs in between 0.4% and 4% of adults below age 60, its prevalence and related impairment of routine daily actions increasing dramatically with age. More than half of patients do not regain functional independence with medications. These patients are offered functional neurosurgical approaches that carry procedural risk or adverse effects secondary to deep electric stimulation of surgical lesioning. Hence, there is a substantial need for alternative, non-invasive therapeutic options for this disabling neurological disorder. Recently, non-invasive neuromodulation applied as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), has emerged as promising for tremor control. In healthy subjects, tACS applied with a high definition (or focused) montage to the primary motor cortex (M1), was found to entrain physiological tremor; in patients with Parkinson's disease, tACS could decrease the amplitude of rest tremor when the stimulation was delivered in phase with, and at the same frequency of, the tremor. Tremor in ET could also be entrained applying ACS to the arm skin's peripheral nerves (transcutaneous ACS), but its effect on tremor amplitude is unknown.

METHODS AND POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION/IMPACT OF THE RESEARCH.

The proposed project aims to explore the whole potential of tACS for the tremor suppression in ET. The investigators aim to test the following hypotheses:

1. focused (or high definition, HD) tACS delivered over M1 at the same frequency of the tremor is effective in decreasing tremor amplitude in ET;
2. this effect is strongest when the delivery of tACS is locked to the phase of the tremor expressed by the patient, i.e. administering tACS in a closed-loop modality;
3. transcutaneous ACS in the upper extremities is as effective as tACS applied to the scalp around M1.",NO,Essential Tremor,DEVICE: transcranial Altering Current Stimulation|DEVICE: Sham tACS,"Essential Tremor Severity Change, The tremor severity will be assessed in the participants by a Movement Disorders Neurologist., Right before and immediately after the intervention",,,University of Calgary,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,REB20-0889,2020-10-01,2021-10,2022-08,2020-08-12,,2020-09-02,,

NCT02180139,tDCS in Cervical Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02180139,,WITHDRAWN,"Dystonia is a devastating disorder defined by involuntary, sustained muscle contractions or abnormal postures that can affect any part of the body. Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most pervasive form of dystonia affecting 60-90,000 individuals in the United States alone and is characterized by involuntary twisting of the neck. The symptoms of CD are disabling, disfiguring, painful, and have a strongly negative impact on quality of life, including social withdrawal and depression. At present, there is no treatment that has been shown to have long term benefit in CD. Standard of care (SOC) is botulinum toxin, which temporarily paralyzes affected muscles, resulting in reduced muscle spasms. This treatment has many undesirable side effects, variable effectiveness, is expensive, and must be repeated every 3 months throughout the lifespan. Physical therapy based treatments aimed at retraining posture or stretching dystonic muscles are largely ineffective and not typically delivered as a part of standard of care. There is an urgent need for novel and effective therapies. Emerging technologies, specifically non-invasive brain stimulation (NBS), have demonstrated compelling evidence to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with CD. In this study, individuals with cervical dystonia will be randomly assigned to receive tDCS for 15 minutes daily for 4 days in 1 of 4 stimulation location groups.

Hypothesis 1: One location of stimulation will result in clear benefit with at least 1 standard deviation (SD) improvement in the CDQ-24, the primary outcome measure, at 1-week follow-up.

Hypothesis 2: The cortical silent period will be the most sensitive measure investigated and will demonstrate significant increase in inhibition as determined by an elongation of silent period in the affected upper trapezius muscle.

Hypothesis 3: The stimulation location determined to be most effective in Objective 1 will produce the greatest physiologic change in inhibition increase.

Hypothesis 4: The hypothesis for this aim is if certain characteristics can predict response to treatment, a strong association will be seen between baseline measure(s) and the primary outcome measure.

Brain stimulation that uses electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp (also called ""non-invasive brain stimulation"") increases brain excitability and has the potential to make it easier for the brain and nervous system to respond to arm and hand training. The purpose of this study is to compare four different types of stimulation for increasing brain excitability to determine which types are best for helping people with tetraplegia improve their ability to use their arms and hands.

NCT04606979,tDCS of the Primary Motor Cortex to Improve Implicit Motor Sequence Learning in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04606979,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a form of cognitive function that is known to be directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research in healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects - hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, however, only null-effects have been reported in persons with PD. In the present study, the investigators will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the Serial Reaction Time task, in persons with PD. The investigators will determine immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also short-term (five minutes post-tDCS) and long-term (one week post-tDCS) consolidation effects, as previous studies suggest that tDCS exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL in a consolidation phase rather than in an acquisition phase.

These deficits increase the risk of falls and reduce functional independence.

The concomitant psychiatric symptoms, especially depression, are often observed and have also great impact on patients' quality of life. The treatment of depressive symptoms in PD with antidepressants as the majority remains variable and inefficient, which complicates the disease prognosis. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain modulation technique and has been demonstrated to improve psychiatric diseases such as major depression. In this study the investigators will assess the combined effects of tDCS on sertraline for the treatment of depression in PD. Ten sessions of tDCS in two weeks will be applied and the follow-up evaluation will continue bi-weekly for one month after completing all sessions. The efficacy of tDCS vs sertraline will be compared and evaluated with behavioral and cognitive outcome. In addition, the investigators will evaluate if the baseline dopaminergic activity in brain could predict the treatment outcome by using SPECT imaging.

The deficits one sees are the result both of the congenitally induced brain lesion and the subsequent plasticity that can impair function of the surviving neurons in the damaged brain.

Many current treatments have limited influence on children's neurorecovery. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) involving constraining the unaffected limb to encourage use of the affected limb has shown promise, yet with new technology revealing the potential to directly influence the brain, there is an urgent need to study the synergy of combined techniques.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) as a direct neuromodulatory intervention has the potential to act synergistically with CIMT to influence neurorecovery.

Combining behavioral therapies, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), with a novel form of neuromodulation, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), we investigated the influence of this intervention on improved motor outcomes in children with cerebral palsy. The study hypotheses surround the safety, feasibility and efficacy of combined CIMT and tDCS wherein those children who receive the combined intervention will reveal no major adverse events, yet improved hand function and cortical excitability.

To Note: In addition to the combination of NIBS with CIMT, we also investigated the combination of NIBS with another form of motor intervention, bimanual, or two-handed, training. During bimanual training, children engage both hands in movements. The goal of bimanual training is to teach children how to most effectively use their hands cooperatively. During bimanual training, children play with games and toys that require the use of both hands.

NCT05919485,The Effects of Specific tDCS on Cognition in MCI,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05919485,,RECRUITING,"INTRODUCTION:

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the lateral parietal (LPC) cortex are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Parietal memory network (PMN) integrity alterations and default mode network (DMN) alterations also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that modulates functional connectivity and might be useful to interfere with cognitive decline in relation to amnestic MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson's disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC and LPC.

METHODS:

This is a multicenter, randomized, and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of anodal tDCS (atDCS ) applied bilaterally to the DLPFC/F3-F4 and LPC/ P3-P4 for 5 sessions with a total of 10 sessions in 14 days. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2 mA current frequency and will last 20 minutes a day for 5 days a week. The study consists of anodal, and sham control groups with a total of 120 participants with DLPFC and LPC anodal groups including 40 participants each and sham including 40 participants which are all between 45-80 years of age.

At baseline and as an outcome measure, neurocognitive evaluation will be conducted using various tests standardized to use in the Turkish population. Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) will be used to detect possible PMN and DMN alterations and hippocampal connectivity, and electroencephalogram (EEG) will be used to assess possible electrophysiological alterations that may happen as a result of atDCS. Baseline evaluation will be done before atDCS sessions and it will be repeated at the end of 14 days and 90 days.

DISCUSSION:

This study aims to explore the effectiveness of atDCS in PD-MCI, aMCI and to contribute to the literature in the field.",NO,Alzheimer Disease|Parkinson Disease,PROCEDURE: tDCS,"Neuropsychological Tests Scores, Moca, AdCom Scores, Changes Before Treatment and 14 Days&90 Days after treatment","EEG Power Spectrum Analysis, EEG data will be separated into one-second epochs after they are cleared of noise. Power spectrums of these data will be obtained in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands. Each epoch will be analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT, Fast Fourier Transform) with 10% Hanning window, then power spectrum analysis will be performed, giving the frequency values for each electrode by averaging all FFTs. Maximum peaks will be determined in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz), theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (15-28 Hz) and gamma (28-48 Hz) frequency bands. these values will be used in statistical analysis for each person and electrode., Changes Before Treatment and 14 Days after treatment|EEG Coherence Analysis, Coherence measurements at delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies can be analyzed for either intra-hemispheric electrode connections or inter-hemipheric electrode connections.Coherence values take values between 0-1. Values close to 0 indicate that there is no connection at the determined frequency between the two calculated electrode regions, while values close to 1 indicate a high coupling between the two electrode regions. Coherence values will be calculated with the Brain Vision Analyzer program using the formula below.The data obtained during memory and visualization will be separated into one-second epochs after they are cleared of noise.Power spectrums of these data will be obtained in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands.

In this software, resting state data with eyes closed, separated into 2 second epochs, whose artifacts are cleaned by preprocessing, will be used. The relevant areas to be analyzed in the cortical plane and the relevant frequency band gaps will be determined. The time series containing the eLORETA current source density obtained from these areas will be calculated and a ""lagged linear coherence"" matrix will be created to be applied in graph theory (Vecchio et al., 2014).

Patients between 40 and 80 years of age with moderately severe Parkinson's disease whose main symptoms are problems with walking, including freezing, or rigidity, may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be taking Sinemet or another L-DOPA drug and not have too much tremor.

Participants will be assigned to receive either real or sham (placebo) tDCS. Both groups will have eight treatments over 3-1/2 weeks. For the tDCS, electrodes are placed on wet pads on the scalp. An electrical current passes through the electrodes, travels through the scalp and skull, and causes small electrical currents in the cortex-the outer part of the brain. Participants will have a neurological examination, including an evaluation of walking, just before and just after each tDCS session. Patients' motor function will be re-evaluated at 1, 3, and 6 months after the last tDCS treatment.

NCT04046055,Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04046055,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects approximately 1 million people in the United States with total annual costs approaching 11 billion dollars. The most common symptoms of PD are tremor, stiffness, slowness, and trouble with balance/walking, which lead to severe impairments in performing activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective add-ons to current therapeutic treatment approaches would have many benefits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can affect brain activity and can help make long-term brain changes to improve functions like walking and balance. While a few initial research studies and review articles involving tDCS have concluded that tDCS may improve PD walking and balance, many results are not meaningful in real life and several crucial issues still prevent tDCS from being a useful add-on intervention in PD. These include the selection of stimulation sites (brain regions stimulated) and tDCS electrode placement. Most studies have targeted the motor cortex (brain region that controls intentional movement), but there is evidence that the cerebellum - which helps control gait and balance, is connected to several other brain areas, and is easily stimulated with tDCS - may be a likely location to further optimize walking and balance in PD. There is also evidence that certain electrodes placements may be better than others. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of cerebellar tDCS stimulation using two different placement strategies on walking and balance in PD.

Additionally, although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities (for example, 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently used in most tDCS research are less than 2 mA, which is sufficient to produce measurable improvements; but, these improvements may be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate stimulation approaches were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities (for example, up to 4 mA) have been performed in different people and were found to have no additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established, studies exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e., 2 mA) and higher (i.e., 4 mA) intensities are necessary to determine if increasing the intensity increases the effectiveness of the desired outcome.

Prospective participants will include 10 people with mild-moderate PD that will be recruited to complete five randomly-ordered stimulation sessions, separated by at least 5 days each. Each session will involve one visit to the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and will last for approximately one hour. Data collection is expected to take 4-6 months. Each session will include walking and balance testing performed while wearing the tDCS device.

This reduction in performance is referred to as the DT deficit or DT cost and is typically much higher in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) than in young adults or age-matched controls. In PD, this DT cost impairs the gait pattern, as manifested, for example, in increased gait variability, exacerbating instability and fall risk.

They can cause falls and are therefore associated with the negative spiral of (near) falls, fear of falling, fractures, reduced mobility and social isolation; hence, having a profound negative impact on quality of life (Lin et al. 2012). Originally, symptoms of PD were ascribed to dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia dysfunction (Wu et al. 2013). However, in the last decades it has become clear that other brain structures are also involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Snijders et al. 2011; Stefani et al. 2007). An intriguing, emerging insight is that the cerebellum may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Wu et al. 2013). That is, the cerebellum is hyperactive in PD patients during different motor tasks (Yu et al. 2007; Hanakawa et al. 1999; del Olmo et al. 2006). However, whether cerebellar hyperactivity is pathological or compensatory and how it affects gait and balance in PD patients remain open questions.

NCT04762823,Multiple Sessions of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in People With Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04762823,,WITHDRAWN,"Parkinson's disease (PD) affects approximately 1 million people in the US, with annual health care costs approaching $11 billion. PD results from a loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain. This decrease in dopamine is associated with shaking, stiffness, slowness, balance/walking problems, thinking, and fatigue which severely impair activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective therapies would have significant benefits.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can influence how the brain works. A review of studies concluded that, overall, tDCS improves walking and balance in people with PD (PwPD). However, these studies had mixed results. For example, most have stimulated the frontal brain areas and all have used intensities of 2 mA (milliamperes; a measure of electrical current strength) or less. However, given the vital role of the cerebellum in walking and balance, and in PD impairments, the cerebellum may represent a more effective brain target. A recent review of studies also recommended performing investigations of higher intensity tDCS (greater than 2 mA), to potentially increase stimulation efficacy. No study has investigated the effects of multiple sessions of cerebellar tDCS on gait and balance in PwPD and none have used tDCS intensities greater than 2 mA. Therefore, there is a critical need to determine if repeated sessions of cerebellar tDCS might improve walking and balance in the short- and long-term.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Healthy Adult,DEVICE: Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation at 4 mA|DEVICE: Sham cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation,"Movement Disorder Society version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPRDS), The scale includes four parts that assess activities of daily living (Parts I and II), a motor exam (Part III), and medication-related motor complications (Part IV).

NCT06214377,Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Treating Parkinson´s Disease-related Pain in OFF State,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06214377,,RECRUITING,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Pain is a significant symptom in PD, affecting a large percentage of patients and impacting their quality of life. The mechanisms of pain in PD involve complex changes in pain-modulating pathways, including dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic systems.

To address the lack of pain management strategies, the investigators propose exploring non-pharmacological therapies like transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a safe and non-invasive technique that modulates neuronal activity. It has shown positive effects on pain processing in healthy individuals and chronic pain patients, but its potential for PD-associated pain remains largely unexplored.

The primary motor cortex (M1) is a target for tDCS as it is believed to influence pain processing in other brain regions involved in sensory and emotional aspects. Initial studies suggest the benefits of tDCS in PD, including enhanced motor potentials and potential modulation of dopaminergic pathways. However, there are currently no published studies specifically investigating the effects of tDCS on PD-related pain, highlighting the need for further research.

A proof-of-concept trial is proposed to examine the effects of a single tDCS session on M1 in PD patients during the OFF state (without medication) and after taking dopaminergic medication. The study aims to assess the pain-relieving effects of tDCS in PD and explore potential synergies between tDCS and dopaminergic medication.

NCT03025334,tDCS on Parkinson's Disease Cognition,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03025334,tDCS-PD-fMRI,RECRUITING,"Parkinson's disease (PD) has been classically regarded as a ""movement disorder"", so earlier work has focused on treating motor symptoms only. As PD patients now have longer life expectancy, the relatively slowly progressing cognitive deficits (compared to their motor deficits) have become one of the major challenges. Approximately 80% of PD patients eventually become demented. Therefore cognitive dysfunction is one of the most significant factors affecting the quality of life of patients with PD. While dementia in Parkinson's disease is routinely treated by cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil and rivastigmine), their efficacy on mild cognitive impairment found in non-demented PD is questionable. Alternative approaches have been proposed including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) but no consensus has been reached. This can be attributed mainly to: (1) imprecise knowledge of the underlying functional circuitry mediating this disease manifestation and (2) inter-individual variability. Here, the investigators will utilize a novel personalized network analysis approach to elucidate on the underlying mechanisms of the effect of tDCS on cognitive dysfunction in non-demented PD patients.

It has been well documented that the caudate nucleus plays an important role in cognitive dysfunction found in PD. In the investigators' preliminary resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, they have shown that the connectivity of the right caudate nucleus is correlated to cognitive status of PD patients measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The investigators hypothesize that tDCS on the left and/or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may restore the functional connectivity of the right caudate nucleus which may in turn improve patients' cognitive performance.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Mild Cognitive Impairment,DEVICE: High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation,"cognitive performance in neuropsychological tests, 1 month",,,University of Manitoba,Parkinson Society Canada,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,36,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",B2016:052,2017-03-22,2025-08-31,2025-08-31,2017-01-19,,2023-12-01,"University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, R3E 0J9, Canada",

NCT03401996,tDCS in Tourette (TIC-TDCS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03401996,TIC-TDCS,UNKNOWN,"Double-blind randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial of 1 mA bilateral supplementary motor area in adolescents/adults with Tourette syndrome (TS). The primary objectives are to assess and quantify the safety and efficacy on tic severity of 5 inhibitory sessions of active vs. sham tDCS sessions during active tic suppression, and to explore the differences in brain functional activity before and after 5 sessions of active or sham cathodal tDCS in adolescents and adults with TS. Secondary objectives include the assessment of the severity of comorbidities after 5 inhibitory tDCS sessions.",NO,Tourette Syndrome,DEVICE: 1 mA tDCS over bilateral SMA,"Tic severity total subscore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale is the most extensively deployed scale worldwide for measuring tic severity. It requires an experienced clinician using all available information to rate motor and phonic tic severity during the previous week. Five dimensions (number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference) of motor and phonic tics are rated separately on a six point Likert-type scale (zero-five), with each point anchored to descriptive statements and relevant examples. The global score has a zero-one hundred range, composed by severity and overall impairment scores, each of which having a zero-fifty range. Higher values indicate worse outcome., Immediately after last tDCS session|Tic severity total subscore on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), The Yale Global Tic Severity Scale is the most extensively deployed scale worldwide for measuring tic severity.

The global score has a zero-one hundred range, composed by severity and overall impairment scores, each of which having a zero-fifty range. Higher values indicate worse outcome., 1 week after end of intervention","Tic inhibition potential on the Modified Video-Based Tic Rating Scale (MVBTRS), Tic suppression will be measured using the Modified Rush Video-Based Tic Rating Scale through a 5 min video recording (2.5 min head and shoulders and 2.5 min whole body view). The scoring method consists of combining scores rating tic distribution (number of body areas involved, from 0 to 4), tic frequency (number of motor and phonic tics expressed from 0 to 4), and tic severity (for motor tics and for phonic tics, from 0 to 4). The total score range is 0 to 20, with higher values indicating worse outcome. Tic suppression will be expressed as suppression potency (IP), defined as follows: IP = RF-RI/RF, where RF is the Rush score during 'free' ticcing and RI the Rush score during tic suppression. Thus, the higher the IP value, the more efficient the suppression potency., Immediately after and 1 week after last tDCS session|Adverse effects, Semistructured questionnaire on adverse effects, Immediately after and 1 week after last tDCS session|Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression (TS-CGI), The TS-CGI is a clinician-rated seven point ordinal scale that ranks current symptom severity from ""normal"" to ""extremely severe"", rating the overall adverse impact of tics, but does not assess separately the individual dimensions of tics. It shares the same composition with Clinical Global Impression of Severity scales, which are commonly used measures of symptom severity in studies of patients with psychiatric disorders., Immediately after and 1 week after last tDCS session|Individualized-Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (iPUTS), The I-PUTS is a clinician-administered measure that assessed the presence, frequency, intensity, and body region location of urges for individual tics endorsed over the past week using a symptom checklist that paralleled the YGTSS. The clinician inquires about the frequency of endorsed urges on a 4-point scale (1 = ""Urge occurs 0-25% of the time you do the tic"" to 4 = ""Urge occurs 75%-100% of the time you do the tic""). The clinician also inquires about the urge intensity on a 4-point scale (1 = ""minimal intensity/urge can be ignored for a considerable amount of time"" to 4 = ""strong intensity/urge needs relief almost immediately""). When tics and/or urges are not endorsed, items receive a rating of 0. Finally, the clinician inquires about the body region associated with each urge. Items are summed to create a total number of distinct urges (I-PUTS Urge Number), total urge frequency (I-PUTS Frequency), and total urge intensity (I-PUTS Intensity)., Immediately after and 1 week after last tDCS session|Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), The Y-BOCS is a 10-item, clinician-administered scale, that has become the most widely used rating scale for obsessive-compulsive disorder. The Y-BOCS provides five rating dimensions for obsessions and compulsions: time spent or occupied; interference with functioning or relationships; degree of distress; resistance; and control (i.e., success in resistance). The 10 Y-BOCS items are each scored on a four-point scale from 0 = ""no symptoms"" to 4 = ""extreme symptoms."" The sum of the first five items is a severity index for obsessions, and the sum of the last five an index for compulsions. A translation of total score into an approximate index of overall severity ranges between 0 and 40, with higher scores indicating worse outcome., Immediately after and 1 week after last tDCS session",,University of Calgary,,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",REB17-1615,2018-05-01,2021-02-01,2021-04-30,2018-01-17,,2020-03-25,"Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, T2N 4N1, Canada",
