NCT02221544,The Effect of Low-frequency rTMS on Motor Function in PD Patients With Freezing of Gait,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02221544,,UNKNOWN,This study is a double blind comparative study examining the effectiveness of the rTMS treatment on Freezing of Gait (FOG) phenomenon in patients with Parkinson's disease. We hypothesize that treatment using rTMS stimulation on frontal lobe areas will improve gait quality and decrease the frequency of FOG in patients with Parkinson's disease.,NO,Parkinson's Disease,DEVICE: Low-frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation|DEVICE: rTMS maintenance|DEVICE: Sham|DEVICE: Sham maintenance,"Changes in frequency and severity of the freezing of gait phenomenon, The new version of the Freezing of Gait questionnaire will be used to quantify the frequency and severity of this symptom. The score will be compared to baseline., One week post intervention","Community ambulation, Will be assessed using 1) the Habitual Physical Activity Questionnaire (HPAQ). It will quantify the type and amount of regular physical activity. 2) A body-worn small lightweight device that will be worn by the subject for 7 days to monitor stepping and physical activity., One week post intervention|Changes in endurance, This measure will be assessed using the 2 minute walk test. The distance walked during 2 minutes will be compared to baseline performance., One week post intervention|Balance, Balance and lower extremity function will be assessed using performance-based measures: (1) The Four Square Step Test (FSST), (2) The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), and (3) The Mini- Balance Evaluation Systems Test (mini-BEST)., One week post intervention|Immediate changes in blood pressure, Measuring blood pressure will monitor subjects' autonomic response to the treatment. Measures will be compared before and after receiving the treatment, Every session, immediately after receiving the treatment|Immediate change in gait function, Gait speed and variability will be assessed under usual and dual task conditions and while negotiating physical obstacles, using a sensorized 7 meter carpet (PKMAS) and wearable body fixed sensors. These measures will be compared to baseline performance., One week post intervention",,Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER_GOV,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",TASMC-13-NG-599-CTIL,2014-09,2015-12,2016-12,2014-08-20,,2014-08-20,"Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, 64239, Israel",
NCT02734485,Deep TMS for the Treatment of Patients With Parkinson's Disease and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02734485,DeepTMSPARK,COMPLETED,"Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neuro-degenerative disease, counted among atypical parkinsonism (AP). Medical treatment and rehabilitation are extremely limited in AP, therefore it would be very useful to find new ways to improve motor and non motor symptoms in PSP. The Brainway Deep Transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is a new technology of TMS using a particular coil, i.e. H-coil, able to stimulate deeper regions of the brain. Only few studies in literature have evaluated the efficacy of DTMS in Parkinson's Disease and parkinsonism; in particular in PSP patients, a case report showed an improvement in language.",NO,Progressive Supranuclear Palsy|Parkinson's Disease,DEVICE: active Deep TMS|DEVICE: sham Deep TMS,"Change in PSP rating scale total score between baseline evaluations (T0 orT2) and end of treatment (T1 or T3), Clinical measures were summarized as means and standard deviations for all the 19 patients and stratified by treatment (active and sham) and evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation: T1 for first period, T3 for second period)., evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation (after four weeks of treatment): T1 for first period, T3 for second period).","Change in MoCA total score between baseline evaluations (T0 orT2) and end of treatment (T1 or T3), Clinical measures were summarized as means and standard deviations for all the 19 patients and stratified by treatment (active and sham) and evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation: T1 for first period, T3 for second period)., evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation (after four weeks of treatment): T1 for first period, T3 for second period|Change in PDQ 39 total score between baseline evaluations (T0 orT2) and end of treatment (T1 or T3), Clinical measures were summarized as means and standard deviations for all the 19 patients and stratified by treatment (active and sham) and evaluation time, evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation (after four weeks of treatment): T1 for first period, T3 for second period|Change in NMS total score between baseline evaluations (T0 orT2) and end of treatment (T1 or T3), Clinical measures were summarized as means and standard deviations for all the 19 patients and stratified by treatment (active and sham) and evaluation time, evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation (after four weeks of treatment): T1 for first period, T3 for second period|Change in Hamilton rating scale for depression total score between baseline evaluations (T0 orT2) and end of treatment (T1 or T3), Clinical measures were summarized as means and standard deviations for all the 19 patients and stratified by treatment (active and sham) and evaluation time, evaluation time (pre-stimulation: T0 for first period, T2 for second period; post-stimulation (after four weeks of treatment): T1 for first period, T3 for second period",,IRCCS San Raffaele Roma,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE",RP 16/13,2013-10,2014-09,2014-09,2016-04-12,,2023-06-26,"Irccs San Raffaele Pisana, Rome, 00163, Italy",
