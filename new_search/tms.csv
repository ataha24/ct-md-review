NCT02012647,Subthalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02012647,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to examine the brain changes in people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) after they get deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery, compared with people who do not have Parkinson's Disease. Treatment of Parkinson's disease is often difficult and challenging. Deep brain stimulation is an established surgical treatment that is effective for the treatment of PD, but the details of why it helps are not known. In order to achieve maximum benefits from this treatment, it is important to understand how it changes the brain. Specifically, the investigators will study electrophysiology, which is the study of how the brain conducts electrical messages to the rest of the body. To do this, the investigators will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is a painless and non-invasive procedure. They will also conduct motor physiology experiments of the upper and lower limbs to collect data about skeletal muscle movement. The data from this study will help explain whether the electrical changes in the brain have any relation to the physical benefits patients with Parkinson's Disease sometimes receive from DBS surgery.",NO,Parkinson's Disease,PROCEDURE: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)|PROCEDURE: Motor Physiology Testing,"Motor Cortex Excitability, We will measure Motor Cortex Excitability by examining circuitries of inhibition found in the motor cortex which have a reduced function in Parkinson's Disease., As few as 1 days and up to 4 months","Relation between Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale outcomes and physiological measures, The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is used by neurologists to rate the motor impairment of people with Parkinson's Disease.

Repetitive TMS (rTMS) is a non-invasive method of stimulation neural pathways in the brain of conscious subjects through the intact scalp. The investigators hypothesize that excitatory rTMS applied over the motor cortex would increase motor cortex activity and result in an increase in the inhibitory input through the corticospinal tract to the spinal cord, thus reducing alpha neuron hyperactivity and consequently clinical spasticity. In this study, the investigators will apply the stimulation on the legs motor cortex area, which can cover supplemental motor area (SMA). Therefore, not only the spasticity, but also the motor control of legs both can be modulated by stimulation. Theta burst stimulation is a condition of rTMS which was designed by the co-investigator. It has controllable, consistent, long-lasting, and powerful effects on motor cortex physiology and behavior. The investigators therefore design this protocol using theta burst stimulation on the motor cortex of the patients of cerebral palsy.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the primary motor cortex（M1）has been proposed to provide definite analgesic effect for pain syndromes. However, very few placebo-controlled studies have been performed specifically to relieve pain in PD. What's more, based on behavioral measures alone, it is impossible to reveal the full network dynamics reflecting the impact of TMS.

Electroencephalography (EEG), with high temporal resolution, records signal that its origin in electrical neural activity, which makes it suitable for measuring TMS-evoked activation. By recording the TMS induced neuronal activation directly from the cortex, TMS-EEG provides information on the excitability, effective connectivity of cortical area, thus exploring cortical network properties in different functional brain states. In addition, the use of EEG offers great prospects as a tool to select the right patients in order to achieve adequate, long-term pain relief.

NCT00072956,The Physiology of Tricks,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00072956,,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the action of sensory tricks on an occurrence known as surround inhibition when there is a disorder of muscle tone affecting a single body part in isolation. Surround inhibition refers to a situation that suppresses unwanted movements, known as dystonia, in surrounding muscles during voluntary actions. There are tricks-various actions-that people use to temporarily stop those unwanted movements. Such tricks can include touching the affected body part, placing an object in the mouth, pulling the hair, and others. Often these tricks are beneficial early in the illness but become less effective as it progresses. This study is guided by a hypothesis that sensory tricks will restore surround inhibition and by another hypothesis that it is the application of the tricks, not simply sensory input, that is effective in doing that restoring. Emphasis is on cervical dystonia, involuntary actions affecting the neck, in which the tricks commonly involve the cheeks and chin. The technique used in the study is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).

Patients ages 18 and older who have cervical dystonia with at least one effective trick and patients with no effective trick may be eligible for this study. There will also be a control group of healthy participants.

Participants will be asked to show the sensory trick and may be asked to be videotaped. During the TMS procedure, they will be seated in a comfortable chair, with hands placed on a pillow on the lap. Small electrodes-soft strips that stick to the skin-will be placed on the skin to record the electrical activity of some muscles in the neck that are activated by the stimulation from TMS. In TMS, there will be a wire coil held over the scalp. A brief electrical current will be passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Patients will hear a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be muscle twitches of the face, arm, or leg. In addition, patients may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions so that the coil can be positioned appropriately. Patients will sometimes be asked to bite down and tap their teeth slightly for about 1-1/2 minutes at a time. They will be asked to show the sensory trick. The stimulation is usually not painful, although sometimes strong contractions of the scalp muscles can cause discomfort or a headache. Patients can ask to have the procedure discontinued at any time.

NCT04493190,The Effects of Short-term Scapular Control Training in Overhead Athletes With Shoulder Impingement Syndrome,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04493190,,COMPLETED,"Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a common disorder of shoulder joint. SIS has been accounted for 44-65 % of all shoulder pain. It is believed that one important contributing factor is scapular dyskinesis. Patients with SIS demonstrates scapular dyskinesis, including decrease in upward rotation, scapular posterior tilt, and external rotation. Altered muscle activity of scapular muscles may contribute to scapular dyskinesis, such as increase in activity of upper trapezius, and decrease in activity of lower trapezius and serratus anterior. In addition to these changes in neuromuscular control, central nervous system may be re-organized in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. Evidence has been reported that center of gravity of motor mapping changes, corticospinal excitability decreases and inhibition increases in patients with shoulder injuries such as instability, rotator cuff tendinopathy and SIS. These corticospinal changes are believed to be related to chronicity of symptoms and lack of treatment effects.

Previous studies have applied many types of treatments to SIS, such as manipulation, taping, and exercises. However, most studies mainly focused on the outcomes of pain and function, few studies investigated changes in neuromuscular control following treatments. Yet, no study has addressed how corticospinal system changes following treatment in patient with shoulder injuries. Motor skill training, which has been widely used in training healthy subjects or patients with neurological disorders, has been shown to change corticospinal systems, including increasing excitability and decreasing inhibition. To our knowledge, no study has integrated the concepts of motor skill learning into a short-term treatment or investigated the effects of motor skill training on corticospinal systems in patients with SIS. The purposes of the study are to investigate the effects of short-term motor skill training on pain, neuromuscular control, corticospinal system in patients with SIS, and also to investigate whether changes in corticospinal parameters will be related to changes in pain, function and neuromuscular control.",NO,Shoulder Impingement Syndrome|Scapular Dyskinesis,PROCEDURE: Scapular control training|PROCEDURE: General exercise,"Change in neurophysiological measures - Active motor threshold, Active motor threshold (AMT) will be described with the percentage (%) of maximum stimulator output (MSO)., Change from baseline AMT at 6 weeks|Change in neurophysiological measures - Motor evoked potential, Motor evoked potential (MEP) will be described with millivolt (mV) at different points and with different stimulus intensity, Change from baseline MEP at 6 weeks|Change in neurophysiological measures - Cortical silent period, Cortical silent period (CSP) will be measured with millisecond (ms)., Change from baseline CSP at 6 weeks|Change in neurophysiological measures - Short interval cortical inhibition and short interval cortical facilitation, Short interval cortical inhibition (SICI) and short interval cortical facilitation (SICF) will be defined as percentage (%) of conditioning responses vs testing responses, Change from baseline SICI and SICF at 6 weeks|Change in shoulder pain, Pain will be measured with a numerical rating scale (0-10).

NCT03368443,Multiple Practice Contexts to Reduce Context-dependent Learning in PD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03368443,,COMPLETED,"Context-dependent learning (CDL) is a phenomenon that an individual demonstrates superior motor performance in the environmental context in which a task was originally learned and practiced, while the performance may decrease if carried out in a novel context. It has often been observed that after individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) learned how to walk in a clinical setting, they appear to have difficulty generalizing the learned walking ability back to their home or community. To date, no effective intervention approaches have been designed to resolve this CDL for people with PD. One approach that could potentially reduce CDL is to practice a motor task in multiple contexts. Learning a task in multiple contexts would make the participants less likely to rely on the inconsistent ambient contextual information, and could facilitate the generation of stronger motor program and schema. No studies to date have investigated the effects of multiple practice contexts on reducing CDL in people with PD. It is also not clear the characteristics of the participants who would benefit from this type of intervention.

This study aims to investigate the effects of gait training in multiple practice contexts on CDL in individuals with PD. Additionally, this study aims to identify the characteristics of the participants who benefit from the intervention.

Sixty-four participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups: Single-room and Two-room groups. The participants will receive 45 minutes of treadmill training and 15 minutes of over-ground gait training for 12 sessions. Throughout the training sessions, the Single-room group will practice walking in the same room, while the Two-room group will receive gait training in 2 distinct rooms. All participants will be assessed by a blinded evaluator before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the intervention. The participants will undergo a series of cognitive, motor behavior, and neurophysiological examinations.

Group × time repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the partial eta square (η2) will be calculated to determine the intervention effects on the outcome measures. Multiple linear regression analyses will be performed to determine the demographic, cognitive and motor behavior, and neurophysiological characteristics of participants who benefit from the proposed interventions.",NO,Parkinson Disease,BEHAVIORAL: treadmill training and overground gait training,"Context-dependent learning, To evaluate context-dependent learning, a finger sequence task has been specially designed. The participants will use an enlarged keyboard to complete the designed computer finger sequence task., 45 mins|10-Meter Walk Test (10-MWT), The walking ability of the participants with PD will be assessed with the 10-MWT. The participants will be instructed to walk along a 10-meter walkway in their comfortable and fastest walking speed. Gait parameters including velocity, stride length, cadence, strike angle and lift-off angle will be calculated., 5 mins|The Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test, The participants will initially sit on a comfortable chair with hips and knees flexed at 90°. Upon a 'GO' signal, the participants will stand up from the chair, walk for 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The participants will be instructed to complete the task at their preferred/ comfortable speed. Good to excellent test-retest reliability and inter-rater reliability have been established in people with PD., 5 mins|Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale will be used to examine an individual's confidence level of not falling when performing activities of daily living. The ABC Scale contains 16 different activities performed indoors and outdoors. The participants will be asked to rate their confidence level (range from 0% to 100% of confidence) of not falling for each item. An average score of the 16 items (range from 0% to 100%) will be calculated to determine the participant's confidence level of not falling when performing the activities of daily living. The internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the ABC scale in patients with PD were excellent., 5 mins|Corticomotor excitability, Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to evaluate corticomotor excitability. Corticomotor excitability outcomes will include resting motor threshold (RMT), motor evoke potential (MEP), cortical silent period (CSP) duration, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI). The RMT could reflect the membrane excitability of the corticospinal neurons and the cortical interneurons. Peak-to-peak MEP amplitude is an indicator of the integrity and excitability of the corticospinal tract. The CSP is a period when EMG activity being suppressed for a few hundred milliseconds after the MEP, and has often been used as an indicator of the inhibitory mechanism occurs within the corticospinal tract. The SICI, ICF, and LICI have been identified to be good indicators of intracortical inhibition and facilitation., 45 mins","Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), The MoCA will be used to evaluate general cognitive function of the participants. It evaluates several cognitive functions including attention, set-shifting, short-term memory, verbal fluency, calculation, orientation, digit span, conceptual thinking, and visuospatial processing skills. The total score of MoCA is 30 with a higher score indicating better cognitive function. The MoCA has good to excellent psychometric properties, 10 mins|The Stroop Color-Word test, The Stroop Color-Word test will be used to evaluate the changes in executive functions in people with PD. The executive functions involved in the Stroop Color-Word test are selective attention, inhibition, and set-shifting. The Stroop Color-Word test comprises the congruent and incongruent testing conditions. The congruent condition is when the color ink of a word is coherent with the written color name, and the incongruent condition is when the color ink differs from the written color name (e.g., the word 'red' written in blue ink). The participants are instructed to read out the ink color of the word, but not the color word name, as accurately and as fast as possible within 45 seconds., 5 mins|The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a well-established and widely used rating tool for the evaluation of disease severity of PD. The UPDRS consists of 4 sections: 1) Mentation, Behavior, and Mood, 2) Activities of daily living (ADL), 3) Motor examination, and 4) Complications of therapy. In this proposed study, we will only evaluate Part 3 of the scale - the motor disturbances of the patients. The section of ""motor examination"" contains 18 tests with 33 items (some tests contain movement of the left and right extremities and/or trunk), and each item scores from 0 (absent of the symptom) to 4 (marked in the symptom and present most of the time). The total score ranges from 0 to 132 for Part 3 of the UPDRS with a lower score indicates less PD symptoms and a higher score suggests more severe in PD disease. Internal consistency and validity has been established to be excellent for UPDRS., 10 mins|Five Times Sit-to-Stand (FTSTS) Test, During the FTSTS test, the participants will be instructed to stand up from a standardized chair and then sit down 5 times as fast as possible. The lesser amount of times that the participants are able to complete the task safely would indicate better strength of the lower extremities. It was found that the test-retest reliability of the FTSTS test was good, and inter-rater reliability was excellent for patients with PD., 5 mins|Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), The PDQ-39 is a self-report questionnaire containing 39 items assessing the impact of PD on quality of life. The PDQ-39 covers 8 dimensions: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. The participants are required to answer the questions based on their experiences in the preceding month prior to the interview. The scoring system for each item ranges from 0 (never have difficulty) to 4 (always have difficulty) with lower scores suggesting better quality of life., 10 mins|New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q), The NFOG-Q will be used to evaluate the freezing frequency and severity of the patients with PD.

NCT04895787,Benefits of Different Exercise Types to Enhance Walking for PD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04895787,,RECRUITING,"Background: Gait disturbance is one of the most common complaints from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It is well-established that people with PD have motor learning impairments. To enhance motor learning, several methods have been recommended, such as sleep, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, and aerobic exercise. To date, only 2 studies have investigated the effects of acute aerobic exercise on motor learning in people with PD. It is yet unclear whether adding aerobic exercise after multiple motor training sessions can enhance motor learning in people with PD. Additionally, most prior evidences utilized moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise to facilitate motor learning, it is yet unclear whether other types of exercise (e.g., resistance training) could induce similar beneficial effects. Therefore, this proposed project is specifically designed to investigate the effects of adding aerobic or resistance exercise after motor training. To take a step further, this project will also determine the patient characteristics who may benefit from the intervention.

Objectives: (1) To examine whether adding specific exercise after training can facilitate learning on patients with Parkinson's disease. (2) To determine the characteristics of participants who may benefit from these types of intervention approach.

Methods: A total of 76 participants with idiopathic PD diagnosed by neurologists will be recruited. All eligible participants will be randomized into one of the 4 groups: aerobic group (AEX), resistance group (REX), conventional PT group (CPT), and control group (CON). All participants will receive 12 sessions of gait training. All outcome measures will be assessed before the intervention (pre-test), after the 6th intervention session (mid-test), after all 12 intervention sessions (post-test), and 1-month after the intervention (follow-up test). All assessments will be performed by an independent research assistant who will be blinded to the group allocation of the participants.

These are repetitive, sudden, semi-voluntary movements or sounds. In some children, these tics can be especially bad and require treatment, however, options are limited. It is only with time and practice that youth with Tourette syndrome are better able to suppress their tics. For these reasons, new interventions are needed. The investigators will target a brain region involved in tics called the supplementary motor area. Using low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, the investigators will inhibit the activity, in a similar way to the tic suppression that develops with age. The investigators propose the following objectives: (Aim 1) The investigators hypothesize that Tourette syndrome symptom severity (as measured by the Yale Global Tic severity Scale) will decrease with low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the supplementary motor area. (Aim 2) The investigators further hypothesize that improvement in Tourette syndrome symptoms will be moderated by low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation induced changes in GABA and glutamate in the supplementary motor area, and changes in the functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex. Eleven children (7-12 years of age) with Tourette syndrome will be undergo low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (five times a week for three weeks).

Participants undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electromyography (EMG) in two 4-hour sessions, separated by 1 to 7 days.

TMS

A wire coil is held on the subject s scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in muscles of the face, arm or leg. During the stimulation, subjects may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. Repetitive TMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts of impulses. Subjects receive 60 pulses per minute over 15 minutes.

NCT00100503,Brain Reorganization Following Constraint-Induced Therapy in Children With Cerebral Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00100503,,COMPLETED,"This study will examine how therapy changes the way the brain controls movements in children with cerebral palsy. Normally, one side of the brain controls movements in the opposite side of the body. In cerebral palsy, however, this pattern may be different, with one side of the brain controlling movements on the same side of the body. This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain function in children with cerebral palsy before and after therapy.

Children between 9 and 17 years of age with spastic hemiplegia type cerebral palsy will be recruited for this study from the National Rehabilitation Hospital and Georgetown University Center Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and the Sparks Center at UAB in Alabama. In addition, five healthy control children will be recruited from community groups, such as Cub Scouts, Brownies, and schools. Candidates are screened with a review of medical records and neurological and physical examinations.

Healthy controls undergo MRI (described below) twice, 3 weeks apart. Children with cerebral palsy undergo the following tests and procedures:

1. Rehabilitation evaluation at the NIH Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department.
2. MRI: For this test, the child lies on a table that slides in and out of the MRI scanner-a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. He or she wears earplugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during scanning. Images are obtained while the child performs simple finger tapping movements.
3. Movement Testing:

   1. Finger tapping: The child taps buttons on a box hooked up to a computer
   2. Muscle reflex measurements: One method uses a small motor that makes the child's fingers move with sudden, small movements; a second method uses small shocks to the finger or wrist. The shocks feel like a buzz; most are gentle, but some might feel stronger.
4. TMS: This procedure maps brain function. A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the child may be asked to perform simple movements.. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the child may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.
5. Therapy: After these tests, children are randomly selected to receive either standard therapy (neurodevelopmental treatment) or constraint-induced therapy, as follows:

   1. Neurodevelopmental therapy uses principles of movement science to enhance the child's capacity to function. The child receives therapy a few times a week for 3 weeks.
   2. Constraint-induced therapy uses a combination of motor learning method and constraint to teach the new motor skills in the child's affected hand. Children treated with this therapy must live near a special treatment center in Alabama for the 3 weeks of treatment. The child's good arm is constrained with a bivalve, removable cast. The cast is placed before therapy starts and remains in place except when the therapist removes it once a day to examine the good arm. With the cast on, children are encouraged to use their affected hand in new ways. The therapist then uses the motor learning method, building motor programs as a result of practice, to teach them new skills. Motor learning therapy is 6 hours a day.
6.

The purpose of this study is to determine if stimulation of the brain with magnetic pulses can decrease myoclonus. Researchers believe that this may be possible because in studies on normal volunteers, magnetic stimulation made areas of the brain difficult to activate for several minutes. In addition, early studies on patients with myoclonus have shown magnetic stimulation to be effective at decreasing involuntary movements.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to stimulate brain activity and gather information about brain function. It is very useful when studying the areas of the brain and spinal cord related to motor activity (motor cortex and corticospinal tract). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of coil of wire (electromagnet) on the patient's scalp and rapidly turning on and off the electrical current. The changing magnetic field produces weak electrical currents in the brain near the coil. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

Researchers plan to use rTMS for 10 days on patients participating in the study. The 10 day period will be broken into 5 days of active repetitive magnetic stimulation and 5 days of placebo ""ineffective"" stimulation.

NCT01174771,Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Degeneration,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01174771,,COMPLETED,"Drug therapy of atypical parkinsonism is generally considered either ineffective or minimal 1. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find alternative therapies to treat atypical parkinsonian disorders. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive tool that modulates cortical excitability with minimal discomfort and holds therapeutic promise in treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits that are affected in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Corticocbasal Ganglionic Degeneration (CBGD) are likely structurally and functionally segregated. The 'motor' circuit is implicated in parkinsonian akinesia and hypokinesia; a 'prefrontal' circuit is implicated in working memory and mood regulation, and linked with non-motor symptoms such as depression and apathy. In this proposal, we characterize motor and prefrontal network dysfunction in PSP and CBGD patients, and propose that high-frequency and low-frequency rTMS directed over separate motor and prefrontal cortical targets of each network may show specific and selective beneficial effects on motor vs. cognitive function in PSP and CBGD patients, respectively. Quantitative motor outcome measures include timed finger tapping tasks. Quantitative cognitive outcome measures comprise a visual analogue scale (VAS).

Participants undergo the following procedures in five visits:

* Electroencephalography (EEG). Electrodes (metal discs) are placed on the scalp with an electrode cap, a paste or a glue-like substance. The spaces between the electrodes and the scalp are filled with a gel that conducts electrical activity. Brain waves are recorded while the subject lies quietly and sensory stimulation is applied to the thumb or finger.
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body tissues and organs. The patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner, wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 45 minutes, during which time the patient will be asked to lie still for up to 15 minutes at a time.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). An insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil. The current induces a magnetic field that stimulates the brain. There may be a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and a twitch in muscles of the face, arm or leg. During the stimulation, subjects may be asked to keep their hands relaxed or to contract certain muscles.
* Peripheral electrical stimulation. In two experiments, TMS is combined with peripheral electrical stimulation, similar to what is used in nerve conduction studies, to the median nerve at the wrist. There may be muscle twitching.
* Surface electromyography. For TMS tests and peripheral electrical stimulation, electrodes are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the skin to record the electrical activity of three muscles on the right hand.
* Needle EMG. A needle is inserted into a muscle to record the electrical activity.
* Nerve conduction studies. A probe is placed on the skin to deliver a small electrical stimulus, and wires are taped to the skin record the nerve impulses. These studies measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscles.
* Skin biopsy. Two sites are biopsied. A local anesthetic is given to numb the area and a 1/4-inch piece of skin is removed with a special tool.

It will also test whether blocking the sensation causes the tic to stop.

People between 18 and 65 years of age with TS who have at least once tic involving an arm may be eligible for this 3-part study. Those enrolled may participate in all parts or in part 1 or part 2. Those who choose to participate in part 3 must first complete part 2. All must stop taking medication for TS and any other medication that may affect the brain for at least 1 week before the study.

Part 1

After numbing the skin or muscles of the arm or leg where a pre-tic sensation is experienced, the response of the nerves will be tested by asking subjects to rate the strength of the sensation after a pinprick and by stimulating the nerves with small electrical shocks. Then, over the course of approximately one hour, subjects will report pre-tic sensations while their motor tics are counted. The onset of each tic will be identified with EMG, a test using electrodes on the skin to indicate the activity of the muscles.

Part 2

Subjects brain waves are recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG) while they are experiencing tics andpre-tic sensory experiences. MEG is a test that records magnetic field changes produced by brain activity. Subjects sit in a chair under a dome containing magnetic field detectors. They watch a clock and report the time a sensory experience starts. Tics are recorded with EMG. Later, a standard MRI of the brain (scan using a magnetic field and radio waves) is done to see which parts of the brain produced the activity recorded with MEG.

Part 3

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is used to try to stop the pre-tic sensations. For TMS, the subject sits in a chair. A wire coil is held on the subject s scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates a region of the brain. The goal of this stimulation is to reduce the sensory experience that precedes a tic in one region of the body. During stimulation, the subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. This study uses a pattern of repeated pulses delivered in short bursts. Following each train of pulses, the effect of the stimulation on sensation will be tested by asking the subject to rate the strength of a pinprick and of a vibration. In addition, the nerves are stimulated with small shocks to evaluate the effect of the TMS on nerve activity. To determine the effect of TMS on the pre-tic sensation, subjects are asked to watch a clock and report when they are having a sensory experience.

NCT00325091,Long-Term Motor Learning in Focal Hand Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00325091,,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the effects of long-term practice of repeated finger movements in people with focal hand dystonia, as compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause abnormal postures while trying to perform a movement. In focal dystonia, just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or face, is involved.

Right-handed healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia of the right hand 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and neurological and physical examination.

Participants are trained daily for 11 days (excluding weekends) at the NIH and are asked to continue with daily 15 minutes of practice over a 12-week period to perform sequential finger movement task (key presses) with their left hand. They practice initially at NIH and then at home. At each clinic visit, their learning of the motor skill is assessed by recording their performance of 20 consecutive trials of the eight sequences (a total of 160 key presses) in the task.

To evaluate long-term motor learning of the sequential movements, participants are asked to do different task tests at Day 2, Week 4 and Week 12. Brain wave activity, and brain excitability are also measured during these days. In one task, they see a random series of letters on a screen during the sequential finger movements and are asked to say the number of times they see a specific letter. In another task, they are asked to focus on each specific movement while performing the sequential finger movements. During each visit, they are questioned and evaluated for the development of any abnormal movements that may be suggestive of early dystonia.

All participants have an electroencephalogram (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at Day 1, and Day 2 and at Week 4 and Week 12 to evaluate brain activity. For the EEG, electrodes are placed on the subject's scalp and the electrical activity of the brain is recorded while the subject performs the sequence of finger movements. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small electrodes taped to the skin of the subject's arms or legs.

After spinal cord injury, brain-to-muscle connections are often interrupted. Because these connections are important in movement control, when they are not working well, movements may be disturbed. Researchers have found that people can learn to strengthen these connections through training. Strengthening these connections may be able to improve movement control and recovery after injuries.

Research participants will be asked to stand, sit, and walk during the study sessions. Electrodes are placed on the skin over leg muscles for monitoring muscle activity. For examining brain-to-muscle connections, the study team will use transcranial magnetic stimulation. The stimulation is applied over the head and will indirectly stimulate brain cells with little or no discomfort.

Typically, young children have what are known as subtle neurological signs. These are involuntary movements of one part of the body that occur while the child is making a voluntary movement of another part of the body. This is referred to as synkinesis, or overflow movements. These overflow movements disappear during normal development and are usually gone by the age of 10. However, in children with ADHD these overflow movements tend to be more intense and last long after the age of 10. This leads researchers to believe there is an abnormality in the maturation and development of the brain areas associated with motor activity in children with ADHD.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that gives information about brain function. It is very useful when studying areas of the nervous system related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). A magnetic signal given from a special instrument held close to the patient's head stimulates a small area of the brain that controls a few muscles (for example, the muscles that control one finger). Doctors put electrodes (small pieces of metal taped to areas of the body) over the muscle to measure the electrical activity the muscle produces when it makes a movement. When the magnetic signal activates those muscles the electrodes pick up and record the electrical activity of the movement that the muscles make in response to the magnetic signal.

Researchers will study normal children and those diagnosed with ADHD using TMS to find out if the clinical abnormalities of ADHD are associated with a delay or abnormality in maturation of areas of the nervous system responsible for motor activity (motor cortex and corticospinal tract).",NO,Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity,,,,,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,200,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,990034|99-N-0034,1999-01,,2004-02,1999-11-04,,2008-03-04,"National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary muscle contractions cause uncontrolled twisting or abnormal postures. Dystonia may be focal, involving just one region of the body, such as the hand, neck or face. Focal dystonia usually begins in adulthood. Generalized dystonia, on the other hand, generally begins in childhood or adolescence. Symptoms begin in one area and then become more widespread.

Healthy normal volunteers and patients with focal or generalized dystonia 8 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. First-degree relatives of patients will also be enrolled.

In transcranial magnetic stimulation, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp and brief electrical currents are passed through the coil, creating magnetic pulses that pass into the brain. These pulses generate very small electrical currents in the cortex-the outer part of the brain-briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. The stimulation may cause muscle twitching or tingling in the scalp, face and limbs. During the stimulation, the subject will be asked to either keep the hand relaxed or to slightly tense certain muscles in the hand or arm. The test will last about 1.5 hours.

NCT01272154,Cerebellum and Cortical Plasticity: the Case of Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01272154,CERDYS,UNKNOWN,"Purpose

- Objective : Sensorimotor adaptation allows the modification of the motor command taking into account the errors detected during execution of prior movements. It involves a large cortico-subcortical network. Isolated lesions of this network do not systematically alter sensorimotor adaptation except for cerebellar lesions. The cerebellum is thus a key structure for sensorimotor adaptation. However, the link between cerebellar and the cortical plasticity underlying sensorimotor adaptation remain unknown. Alteration of sensorimotor adaptation is associated with dystonia but it is unclear whether it is a cause or consequence of dystonia. It has been hypothesized that the abnormal plasticity observed in dystonia could account for the associated alteration of sensorimotor adaptation.

Classically, basal ganglia dysfunction is considered to be crucial for dystonia pathogenesis. However, recent studies suggest that the involvement of the cerebellum may also be important in this setting. In primary dystonia, imaging studies showed abnormal cerebellar activation during sensorimotor adaptation tasks and neurophysiological studies demonstrated a decrease of cerebellar output.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the cerebellum in the cortical plasticity underlying sensorimotor adaptation both in healthy subjects (normal plasticity) and in dystonic patients (abnormal plasticity).

- Methods: Paired associative stimulation PAS consists in repetitive pairing of a peripheral nerve and a cortical stimulation. This kind of stimulation has been designed to induce artificial plasticity that can be easily measured. This PAS induced sensorimotor plasticity is exacerbated and has lost its topographical specificity in dystonic patients.TMS using trains of TMS pulses (rTMS) can be applied on the cerebellum to modulate its output. We will test the effect of rTMS induced modulation (cTBS- inhibitory, iTBS-excitatory, sham) of the cerebellar output on PAS induced plasticity in patients with dystonia and healthy control.

We will also assess the acute effect of the rTMS induced modulation of the cerebellar output on the dystonic symptoms and on the performance at a validated sensorimotor adaptation task. This will be done by double blind post-hoc scoring of the dystonia (BFM or TWSTRS) on standardized videorecording and measurement of the performance at the task after each rTMS session (cTBS, iTBS, sham).

Finally, we will assess the variation of PAS effect on other parameters reflecting cortical excitability after each rTMS session (cTBS, iTBS, sham).",NO,Dystonia,OTHER: Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"Comparison of MEP0/MEP10 and MEP0/MEP30 values obtained after sham, cRTBS or iTBS of the cerebellum., The effect of rTMS induced modulation of the cerebellar output on the PAS induced plasticity will be assessed by measurement of the size variation of a 1mV test motor evoked potential (which reflect cortical excitability) before (MEP0) and 10 and 30 minutes (MEP10 and MEP30) after PAS.

* The brain has natural electrical rhythms of brain activities. These rhythms may be different in people with movement disorders, such as dystonia (involuntary muscle movement, cramps, or tremors). Understanding these rhythms may provide more information about movement disorders.
* Focal hand dystonia, also known as ""writer's cramp"" or ""musician's cramp,"" is a painful condition that affects the hand and arm muscles. Researchers want to use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study brain rhythms in people with and without focal hand dystonia.

Objectives:

- To better understand brain rhythms involved in focal hand dystonia.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 18 and 70 years of age who are right-handed and have focal hand dystonia.
* Healthy right-handed volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.

Design:

* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.
* This study includes two tests: a pilot test and a main test. The pilot test will determine the frequency of TMS that will be used in the main test. Participants may be in one or both tests. Each test requires a single outpatient visit that will last up to 5 hours.
* Participants will have a base test to see how their muscles respond to TMS. This will look at the electrical activity of the muscles. Participants will have a wire coil held on their scalp. A brief electrical current will pass through the coil. It creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. Researchers will test the TMS on the right and left sides of the head. This will help find the spot that activates the finger muscles, and see how much TMS is needed.
* In the main test, participants will have repetitive TMS (rTMS). rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts. There will be four pulses in each burst. Participants will have multiple bursts during the test. This test will look at how the muscles of the hand and fingers respond to brain stimulation.

NCT03273270,Effects of Neuromodulation and Rehabilitation of the Locomotor Network in Freezing of Gait,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03273270,TMS/FOG,COMPLETED,"Freezing of gait (FoG) is a common and debilitating condition in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients. FoG is described as an episodic inability to walk, which often triggers falls, hospitalization and is an important predictor of poor quality of life. As locomotor regions degenerate in PD, gait automaticity is impaired. Patients compensate by increasing volitional control of gait, however, this adaptation has been found to worsen FoG severity. We hypothesize that increased cortical control of gait is maladaptive, and therapies to improve gait automaticity will not be effective unless cortical control of gait is reduced. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a therapeutic approach for FoG that simultaneously reduces cortical control and increases automaticity of gait. The objective is to determine the locomotor network abnormalities responsible for FoG and demonstrate how neuromodulation and rehabilitation can modulate the network. The rationale of this study is that increased connectivity between brainstem locomotor regions and cortical structures represents increased cortical governance of gait, and it can be reversed by the proposed intervention. We will accomplish this by combining a course of inhibitory rTMS (1Hz) to the cortex (supplementary motor area) with a rehabilitation protocol designed to increase gait automaticity (dual task training). We have designed a study that will carefully assess the locomotor network of freezers with resting state functional, diffusion and interleaved TMS/BOLD MRI studies, before and after intervention. Behavioral measures including gait analysis, cognitive and motor assessments will also be conducted at baseline and post treatment. The study aims to determine the effects of our intervention on the locomotor network (assessed with imaging), as well as on FoG severity as quantified through multiple markers obtained through gait analysis. At the conclusion of the study we expect to have determined the network changes central to the pathophysiology of FoG, the effects of 1Hz rTMS + rehabilitation on this network, and on FoG severity.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) effects over the cortex and affects the subcortical neural circuits. Previous studies have demonstrated that rTMS can improve FOG for PD patients. In the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) study, the invastigators aim to investigate the efficiency of rTMS over different motor regions of frontal lobe. The efficacy of treatment is evaluated by the score of FOG questionnaire and FOG provoking test, and the changing of neural network shown by functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).

NCT00102999,Brain Function in Focal Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00102999,,COMPLETED,"Objectives

The main objectives of this proposal are (1) to characterize motor learning abnormalities in patients with focal dystonia; (2) to show, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, that this abnormal motor learning went together with an impaired modulation by somatosensory inputs of short and long-interval paired-pulse inhibitions (sICI, lICI) and facilitations (sICF, ICF) of MEPs (ICIs and ICFs are thought to reflect activity of inhibitory and excitatory interneuron's in the primary motor cortex M1); (3) to show that abnormalities of long-term potentiation and long-term depression (LTP/LTD)-like mechanisms (tested using a paired associative stimulation (PAS) intervention), thought to play a crucial role in learning, are associated in dystonia with an abnormal modulation of ICIs and ICFs by somatosensory inputs.

Study population

30 patients with a focal upper limb dystonia and 45 healthy volunteers will take part in the main study. 7 patients with a focal upper limb dystonia and 12 healthy volunteers will take part in the control study.

Design

In the main study: subjects will complete 5 different sessions: visit 1: clinical screening, 1 hour; visit PAS session, 3 hours; visit 3: a minimum of 7 days later, motor learning session, 3 hours; visit 4: follow-up 24 hours later, 1 hour and a half; visit 5, follow-up 48 hours later, 1 hour and a half. During the PAS session they will receive 15 minutes of repeated paired stimulations (transcranial magnetic stimulation -TMS- and peripheral stimulation) thought to produce LTP/LTD like phenomena in M1. During the motor learning sessions they will be asked to perform, as fast as possible, a metronome-paced (0.5 Hz) pinch of their index finger and thumb. They will have 3 blocks of motor practice during the motor learning session.

Between each block of motor practice and before and after PAS, while they rest, subjects will receive paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations (TMS) associated or not with peripheral nerve stimulation in order to assess interactions at M1 cortical level between somatosensory incoming volleys and intracortical inhibitory and excitatory interneuron's.

In the control study: subjects will complete a unique session. They will receive a PAS intervention. Before and after the PAS intervention, spinal excitability will be tested by the means of H reflexes evoked in wrist flexor muscles.

Outcome measures:

The behavioral effect of the motor training or of the PAS intervention will be assessed by measuring the mean peak acceleration (MPA) of thumb movement during the blocks of motor practice and the mean maximal peak force (MPF) between the index finger and thumb before and after the blocks of motor practice.

The activity of different sets of intracortical interneurons (short and long interval GABA related inhibitions: sICI, lICI, intracortical glutamate-related facilitation: ICF and short interval facilitation: sICF) can be tested using paired-pulse TMS paradigms. The effect of learning (or of PAS intervention) on the interaction between somatosensory afferent input and intracortical processes will be assessed by comparing the amount of sICI, lICI, ICF and sICF when associated or not with a peripheral nerve stimulation (median and ulnar nerve stimulation) in a trained muscle (flexor pollicis brevis: FPB) and a non-trained muscle (abductor digiti minimi: ADM) at different times during and after the motor learning or the PAS intervention.

The cardinal symptoms of PD are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Gait disturbance is also one of the key features of PD. At present, the mainstream treatment of PD is the dopaminergic supplement. However, the response to the medical treatment varies between symptoms. Rigidity and bradykinesia respond to the medical treatment the best, and tremor respond partially. Gait disorders do not usually respond to the dopaminergic medication. Freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the most notorious and devastating presentation of gait disorders in PD. Currently, there is no available treatment for FOG, even the invasive deep brain stimulation does not work on it. Repetitive transcortical magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel non-invasive intervention. Through the magnetic stimulation, brain neurons could be activated by the electrical current. The application of rTMS had been approved by US FDA for the treatment of depression. The possible effect of rTMS may result from the stimulation-related neuronal plasticity. Regarding PD, rTMS also had been found to had some effect on different motor symptoms, mainly on the bradykinesia and rigidity but not gait.

NCT05512299,Investigating Cerebellar Inhibition and Its Clinical Significance in Parkinsonian Tremor and Intention Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05512299,,RECRUITING,"Cerebellocerebral connection plays an important function in motor control. Nowadays it can be investigated with neuroimaging and physiological methods in humans. Cerebellar inhibition (CBI) is a phenomenon showing a physiological suppression of the motor evoked potential (MEP) evoked from the motor cortex (M1) by delivering a preceding transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the contralateral cerebellum. Despite the mediated pathway is supposed to be the cerebello-dentato-thalamo-cortical (CDTC) circuit, there is no conclusive evidence. In addition, the clinical significant of CBI remains unclear. Based on our previous studies, we found that the patients with advanced tremor show an impaired Bereitschaftspotential. The findings support a notion that the patients with tremor bear dysfunction of the CDTC circuit. Intriguingly, the pathogenesis of the parkinsonian tremor is highly associated with the CDTC circuit. The ""dimmer-switch"" model suggests that the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit dysfunction may initiate the resting tremor, and the following CDTC circuit dysfunction will lead to the large-amplitude resting and postural tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD). The intention tremor is usually found in the patients with cerebellar degeneration, which is also relevant to the CDTC circuit dysfunction. We expect that the clinical significance of CBI and the mediated pathway of CBI will be clarified by this study.",NO,Tremor,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,"Change from baseline cerebellar inhibition (CBI) input output curve, The CBI is recorded with two different TMS coils. The figure-of-eight coil (2X90 mm) is used for the motor cortex stimulation and the double cone coil (2X126 mm) is used for the cerebellar stimulation. The target recording muscle is first dorsal interosseous (FDI). The TMS intensity used to induce an average MEP amplitude of 0.5 mV is also determined. CBI is measured by a paired TMS with an inter-stimulus interval of 6 ms. That is, the test TMS at M1 is delivered 6 ms following the conditional TMS at contralateral cerebellum.

There are five TMS intensities used for the conditional cerebellar stimulation: 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% and 120% inion active motor threshold. Ten trials are recorded for each TMS intensity with a pseudorandomized order.

The study will use a new device called a modified peg board test (see description below) to measure whether antiparkinsonian medications (levodopa/carbidopa or dopamine) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, see description below) of the brain can improve the symptoms of sequence effect.

Patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease who have never taken antiparkinsonian medications and patients with advanced disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates must be 18 years of age or older and right-handed.

Participants have five visits to the NIH Clinical Center as follows:

* Visit 1 (baseline): Patients have a neurological examination, including brief cognitive function tests, a rating for depression, and two types of ratings for fatigue severity.
* Visits 2 through 5 (experimental sessions): Patients who have been taking antiparkinson medication for a long time are asked to not take their medication for about 12 hours (overnight withdrawal) before visits 2 through 5. They are off medication for about 14 hours total (until after the experiments are done). Patients may be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for the overnight drug withdrawal if necessary. At the start of each session, participants are given either levodopa/carbidopa tablets or placebo (tablets identical in appearance but with no active medication). They perform the modified pegboard test before medication, after medication, and after brain stimulation with rTMS. During two of the sessions, they receive actual brain stimulation, and during the other two sessions they receive sham stimulation, which does not actually stimulate the brain.

The modified pegboard test is a computer-based machine with eight pegs. Subjects transfer each peg from a line of holes on the right side to a line of holes on the left side using their right hand and moving as quickly as possible. After they finish moving all pegs to the left line of holes, they wait for a beep and then transfer the pegs from left line to right line of holes.

Blepharospasm and Meige syndrome cause excessive involuntary closure of the eyelids or blinking. In an earlier study of patients with writer's cramp, which is another form of dystonia, symptoms improved temporarily with brain stimulation.

Interested people 18 years of age or older with blepharospasm or Meige syndrome may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and a blink reflex test.

Participants undergo brain stimulation and evaluations before and after the stimulation to test the response, as follows:

Procedures

* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): A wire coil is held on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. The subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. TMS is done on eight of the ten test days.
* Repetitive TMS (rTMS): The same procedure as TMS, except repeated magnetic pulses are delivered in short bursts. RTMS is done on eight of the ten test days.
* Theta burst stimulation (TBS): A form of rTMS that involves short bursts of impulses. TBS is done on four study days.
* Cathodal transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS): Two conductive-rubber electrodes placed in saline-soaked sponges are positioned over two areas of the head. A constant weak electrical current flow is applied for 20 minutes. tDCS is done on two study days.

Evaluations

* Physician observation: The subject's eyes are videotaped for 5 minutes before and after each TMS session. A physician then counts how many times the subject blinked during the 5 minutes.
* Questionnaire: Subjects are asked to rate their symptoms before and after brain stimulation.
* Electrophysiological test of the blink reflex: Wires are taped to the skin on the nose and temple to record the eye movement during blinking.

NCT04315285,Optimal Verbal Instruction to Improve Walking for PD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04315285,,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"Background: One of the most disturbing motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) is gait disturbance. Clinicians often use various verbal instructions to correct abnormal gait patterns, and the most commonly used instruction is 'lift the foot up and make big steps.' Despite immediate performance improvement, people with PD are reluctant to walk outdoors with this exaggerated walking strategy because it makes them feel embarrassed, unbalanced, and fatigue easily. Since people with PD walk with flat foot, the investigators propose that an instruction emphasizing heel-strike at foot contact may be effective.

When delivering verbal instructions, clinicians should also consider the attentional focus of the instruction. Evidence has shown that instructions with external focus of attention (EF) is more beneficial than internal focus of attention (IF) for motor performance and learning. However, most of the gait-related instructions for PD are IF. The investigators thus aim to design a novel EF instruction and determine whether people with PD can benefit more from EF than IF instruction.

Objectives: (1) To investigate the effects of verbal instruction emphasizing heel-strike during gait training in people with PD. (2) To further determine whether an instruction with EF will induce greater training benefits than IF.

Methods: Two experiments will be conducted in this study. In experiment 1, 60 individuals with PD will be randomized into the heel-strike (HS), big-step (BIG), and control (CON) groups. All participants will receive 12 sessions of gait training with the specific verbal instruction allocated for each group. The participants will be assessed before, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the interventions. The primary outcome will be gait performance, and the secondary outcomes will include measurements of cognitive and behavioral functions. Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to examine the changes of corticomotor excitability associated with the interventions.

In the 2nd experiment, 46 individuals with PD will be randomized into the internal focus heel-strike (IF-HS) or external focus shoe-strike (EF-SS) group. Except for the verbal instruction provided to the participants, other intervention and testing procedures will be the same as experiment 1.

The executive functions involved in the Stroop Color-Word test are selective attention, inhibition, and set-shifting. The Stroop Color-Word test comprises the congruent and incongruent testing conditions. The congruent condition is when the color ink of a word is coherent with the written color name, and the incongruent condition is when the color ink differs from the written color name (e.g., the word 'red' written in blue ink). The participants are instructed to read out the ink color of the word, but not the color word name, as accurately and as fast as possible within 45 seconds., Three time points: pre-test(before intervention), post-test(immediate after intervention), follow-up test(one month after intervention)|The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is a well-established and widely used rating tool for the evaluation of disease severity of PD.

In this proposed study, we will only evaluate Part 3 of the scale - the motor disturbances of the patients. The section of ""motor examination"" contains 18 tests with 33 items (some tests contain movement of the left and right extremities and/or trunk), and each item scores from 0 (absent of the symptom) to 4 (marked in the symptom and present most of the time). The total score ranges from 0 to 132 for Part 3 of the UPDRS with a lower score indicates less PD symptoms and a higher score suggests more severe in PD disease.

NCT02441985,rTMS Therapy for Primary Orthostatic Tremor,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02441985,,COMPLETED,"Primary orthostatic tremor(POT) is a rare progressive functionally disabling tremor disorder. The characteristic features of POT are symptoms of unsteadiness in legs reported by patients when they are standing and improvement of symptoms upon walking and sitting. Due to the limited success of other treatment options there is a clear merit in continuing efforts to explore and investigate novel treatment modalities. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a well-established physiological tool to understand brain function. When repetitious TMS pulses are delivered to a specific target at predefined stimulation parameters, it is referred to as rTMS therapy.The investigators propose a novel approach to investigate the clinical and physiological effects of low frequency rTMS therapy in POT. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that low frequency rTMS therapy delivered to the cerebellum will modulate the cerebellar excitability and result in clinical improvements.In order to determine the physiological effects related to rTMS, the tremor physiology will also be recorded with surface electromyography (EMG).

NCT05198921,The Effectiveness of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05198921,,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain.

Nowadays, CP is not fully curable, and physiotherapy should be used in conjunction with other interventions such as oral drugs, botulinum toxin type A, continuous pump-administered intrathecal baclofen, orthopaedic surgery and selective dorsal rhizotomy. However, several systematic reviews conclude that there is low evidence that these invasive therapies are more effective than placebo.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a type of neuromodulatory technique through magnetic impulses. The effect of rTMS depends on the frequency of the emitted electromagnetic field; low frequencies (≤1 Hz) lead to an inhibition of neuronal electrical activity at the stimulation site, while high frequencies (≥3 Hz) cause neuronal depolarization.

The objective of the project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) protocol, as an adjunct treatment to neurorehabilitation to improve gross motor function and quality of life in school-age children with spastic diplegia-type infantile cerebral palsy.",NO,"Cerebral Palsy, Spastic",DEVICE: repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation|DEVICE: sham repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,"Change in Gross Motor Function by the Gross Motor Function-66, The GMFM is a standardized assessment instrument designed to measure change over time in gross motor function in cerebral palsy children.

The magnitude of change that is considered clinically important for an individual child will vary and depend on the judgments made by the child, family, and therapist. It takes between 20-25 minutes to be completed. GMFM presents good longitudinal construct validity, the test - retest is high with a 0.99 ICC and researchers indicate that GMFM adequately measure change over time in gross motor function for children with CP., baseline, one month, two months, three months and six months.","Change in Functional Strength by the Functional Strength Measure, The functional strength measurement (FSM) measures functional strength in both, upper and lower extremities. It consists of eight items matching activities of children in aged group from 4 to 10 years with typically developing (TD). The FSM has been adapted for children with CP (FSM-CP). The test-retest reliability of FSM-CP, has shown to be high and the comparison of the scores on the FSM-CP with the HHD showed mostly moderate correlations. In the present study, only the items related to lower extremities will be evaluated. Participants will have the opportunity to practice every test item maximum five trials before being tested.

Healthy normal volunteers and people with Parkinson's disease who are between 21 and 80 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures in five visits to the NIH Clinical Center:

Visit 1

Medical and neurological examination.

Visit 2

Motor training. Participants perform a pinching movement once every other second, timed to a metronome, during rTMS. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. rTMS involves repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts of impulses.

Visits 3 and 4

Brain physiology studies using rTMS, nerve conduction studies (electrical nerve stimulation) and EEG. A nerve at the subject's wrist is stimulated with electrical impulses to measure the speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection between the nerve and the muscle. rTMS is performed for 20 minutes. The EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain (brain waves). For this test, electrodes (metal discs) are placed on the scalp with a conductive gel and the brain waves are recorded while the subject moves his or her thumb briskly for 20 minutes.

Previous studies have suggested that SD and other focal dystonias are associated with decreased inhibition in sensorimotor areas in the brain. However, no studies have investigated the effects of modulating excitability of the laryngeal motor cortex in healthy individuals or SD. The goal of this pilot project is to determine if brain excitability of the laryngeal motor cortex can be changed with low-frequency inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in individuals with SD and healthy controls. Considering that rTMS at low frequencies (≤1 Hz) produces lasting inhibition in the brain, and that SD is associated with decreased cortical inhibition, the purpose of this pilot study is to determine safety, feasibility and response to 1Hz rTMS to the laryngeal motor cortex in individuals with SD and healthy people.

NCT05008289,Effects of Magnetic Stimulation of the Dorsal Spinal Cord on Gait in Patients With Parkinson´s Disease and Deep Brain Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05008289,TMS,UNKNOWN,"Gait disorders are symptoms that significantly compromise the quality of life and functionality of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). When they are not responsive to drug dopaminergic therapy and deep brain stimulation (DBS), the management of these symptoms is a challenge in clinical practice. Although deep brain stimulation is useful in the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, gait symptoms remains a challenge in patients undergoing this therapy. This is because, in addition to adjustments in the DBS programming not adding evident benefit in some patients with gait disorders, motor symptoms tend to progress over the years. In this context, spinal cord invasive electrical stimulation was proposed as a potential and effective therapy in a group of patients with PD who presented with gait impairment. More recently, the application of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord has emerged as a possible therapeutic option, as it could stimulate neural elements in a non-invasive way. The general objective will be to study the effect of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord on gait in PD patients with deep brain stimulation refractory to dopaminergic therapy. The method of the present study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, phase II clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of transcutaneous magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord in patients with PD and deep brain stimulation who present gait disorders refractory to dopaminergic therapy. The primary outcome will be the change in gait speed between pre-stimulation and post-stimulation conditions between the two groups (active and placebo) assessed using the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG). Secondary outcomes will be the effects of stimulation on other gait measures (speed, step length, stride length, cadence, step width, sway time, support time and the presence of blocks), other motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale), cognitive alterations, quality of life and side effects.

Patients with Parkinson's disease often suffer from extremely slow movements (bradykinesia) which result in the inability to perform complex physical acts.

Imaging studies of the brain have provided researchers with information about the specific areas in the brain associated with these motor difficulties. One particular area involved is the surface of the brain called the cerebral cortex.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can be used to stimulate brain activity and gather information about brain function. It is very useful when studying the areas of the brain related to motor activity (motor cortex, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum). Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) involves the placement of a cooled electromagnet with a figure-eight coil on the patient's scalp and rapidly turning on and off the magnetic flux. This permits non-invasive, relatively localized stimulation of the surface of the brain (cerebral cortex). The effect of magnetic stimulation varies, depending upon the location, intensity and frequency of the magnetic pulses.

The investigators want to identify differences in brain regions connecting perception and action between mutation carriers that develop clinical symptoms and those who stay healthy in different subgroups of inherited Parkinson-dystonia syndromes. Mutation carriers with and without symptoms of three different inherited Parkinson-dystonia syndromes will be investigated at their homes with the help of a mobile examination unit.

NCT01200966,Ethanol Response in Essential Tremor: Clinical and Neurophysiological Correlates,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01200966,,COMPLETED,"Background:

- Essential tremor (ET) is a neurological disorder involving uncontrollable shaking, which over time can interfere with mobility and affect routine aspects of daily living. Several medications are used to treat ET, but these medications are often only partially effective and can have side effects. About two-thirds (66%) of people with ET have some relief from drinking alcohol, which suggests that alcohol affects the part of the brain causing the tremor. However, more research is needed to better understand the effects of alcohol or what areas of the brain might be important in the response.

Objectives:

* To study to what extent alcohol is reducing tremor in a group of patients with essential tremor.
* To use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the effects of alcohol on essential tremor.

Eligibility:

- Individuals who are at least 21 years of age, have been diagnosed with essential tremor and have tremor in both hands, and can tolerate being off all medications for essential tremor for up to 4 weeks.

Design:

* This study has one screening visit (1 to 2 hours), followed by one study visit (3 to 5 hours). Participants might be asked to also take part in one additional study visit (3 to 5 hours). The maximum period between the study visits is 3 months.
* Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. At this visit, participants will receive information about how to safely taper off their current ET medications before the start of the study.
* Participants must be willing to abstain from drinking any alcohol or caffeine (or consuming foods with caffeine such as chocolate) for at least 2 days before the study visits. Participants must also fast overnight (for at least 8 hours) before the study visits.
* At the first study visit, participants will receive a single drink of alcohol (mixed with a noncaffeinated drink) and will complete movement tests to determine whether the alcohol improves the tremor. Alcohol levels will be monitored throughout the visit.
* At the second study visit, participants will have an electrocardiogram to measure heart electrical activity and determine if they are able to safely have transcranial magnetic stimulation. Participants will then receive an intravenous infusion of alcohol and complete questionnaires during the infusion to provide information about its effects. Then, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to study brain electrical activity, as well as muscle movements and tremor activity, while under the influence of the alcohol infusion.
* After each study visit, participants will remain at the clinical center until the effects of the alcohol have worn off. Participants will be able to resume taking their ET medications after the end of the study.",NO,Essential Tremor,,Phase 1: To objectively determine the rate of ethanol responders vs. non-responders in a prospective sample of ET patients.|Phase 2: To evaluate changes of SICI in responding vs. non-responding ET patients during a continuous ethanol administration,"Phase 1: To correlate spirographic and clinical response in both hands with breath-alcohol-levels, acquired using a Breathalyzer at constant intervals after ethanol administration.|Phase 2: To evaluate changes additional TMS measures between groups",,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,96,NIH,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,100199|10-N-0199,2010-08-30,,2017-01-04,2010-09-14,,2019-12-17,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

NCT02349789,The Role of Cerebellar Hyperactivity in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02349789,,COMPLETED,"Gait and balance disturbances are one of the most incapacitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Boonstra et al. 2008). They can cause falls and are therefore associated with the negative spiral of (near) falls, fear of falling, fractures, reduced mobility and social isolation; hence, having a profound negative impact on quality of life (Lin et al. 2012). Originally, symptoms of PD were ascribed to dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia dysfunction (Wu et al. 2013). However, in the last decades it has become clear that other brain structures are also involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Snijders et al. 2011; Stefani et al. 2007). An intriguing, emerging insight is that the cerebellum may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Wu et al. 2013). That is, the cerebellum is hyperactive in PD patients during different motor tasks (Yu et al. 2007; Hanakawa et al. 1999; del Olmo et al. 2006). However, whether cerebellar hyperactivity is pathological or compensatory and how it affects gait and balance in PD patients remain open questions. Here, the investigators aim to elucidate the role of the hyperactive cerebellum in gait dysfunction in PD patients by modulating cerebellar excitability with state-of-the-art non-invasive brain stimulation techniques and investigate the effects on gait.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,,"Change in Gait Speed- Sham_On, Change in overground walking speed (10 meter walk test) after Sham transcranial direct current stimulation, participants on medication., One session|Change in Gait Speed- Sham_Off, Change in overground walking speed (10 meter walk test) after Sham transcranial direct current stimulation, participants off medication., One session|Change in Gait Speed- Anodal_On, Change in overground walking speed (10 meter walk test) after Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, participants on medication., One session|Change in Gait Speed- Anodal_Off, Change in overground walking speed (10 meter walk test) after Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation, participants off medication., One session|Change in Gait Speed- Cathodal_On, Change in overground walking speed (10 meter walk test) after Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation, participants on medication., One session|Change in Gait Speed- Cathodal_Off, Change in overground walking speed (10 meter walk test) after cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation, participants off medication., One session",,,"Hugo W.

During fine finger movement, the brain controls muscles in a process called surround inhibition. This process may be impaired in people with hand dystonia, leading to uncontrolled overactivity in muscles and impairing motor function.

In dystonia, muscle spasms cause uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. Focal dystonia involves just one part of the body, such as the hand, neck or face. Patients with focal hand dystonia have difficulty with individualized finger movements, which may be due to increased excitability of the motor cortex.

Patients with hand dystonia 21 years of age or older may be eligible for this 2-month study. Those taking botulinum toxin injections must stop medication 3 months before entering the study.

Participants will undergo a complete neurologic examination. They will undergo motor training with ""constraint-induced movement therapy."" This therapy involves constraining some fingers while allowing others to move. Participants will have the following tests and procedures at baseline (before motor training), after 4 weeks of motor training, and again after 8 weeks:

* Handwriting analysis - A computerized program evaluates the degree of ""automatic movements"" the patient uses in writing, as well as writing pressure and speed.
* Symptoms evaluation - Patients fill out a written questionnaire about symptoms and rate their improvement, if any, after training.
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation - The patient is seated in a comfortable chair, and an insulated wire coil is placed on the scalp. Brief electrical currents pass through the coil, creating magnetic pulses that travel to the brain. These pulses generate very small electrical currents in the brain cortex, briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area.

NCT00977184,50 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00977184,,COMPLETED,"Background:

* In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a device creates a short-lasting magnetic field which induces an electric current in the brain leading to a change in the activity of brain cells. There are different effects on the brain with different rates of stimulation. In a previous study in people with Parkinson's disease, repetitive TMS (rTMS) given at a particular rate temporarily improved their ability to walk. A faster rate of rTMS may be more effective in treating symptoms than the rate originally used.
* This study will compare active rTMS to inactive (sham or Placebo) rTMS. Half of the people in this study will have active rTMS; the other half will have no brain stimulation with rTMS.

Objectives:

- To see if a faster rate of transcranial magnetic stimulation is a more effective treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease than the slower rates that have been studied.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 40 and 80 years of age who have been diagnosed with mild or moderate Parkinson's disease.
* Participants must currently be taking Sinemet or dopamine agonists drugs (e.g., bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, apomorophine, and rotigotine), and are willing to continue their same treatments for the duration of the study.

Design:

* This study requires 11 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over 6 weeks. Participants can also be admitted and stay as an inpatient in the NIH Clinical Center for the entire study period (for the 10 visits during the first weeks and the follow-up visit a month later).
* Initial visit will consist of a physical examination; a test of participants' time to walk 10 meters; and questions about memory, mood, and quality of life. Participants should not take Parkinson's disease medications for 12 hours before this visit; once the examinations and tests are complete, participants will be able to take the medications. Researchers will repeat the tests 1 hour after participants take the medication.
* TMS sessions: 8 TMS sessions (4 sessions per week) over 2 weeks. Each stimulation session will last half an hour. Half of the participants will receive active TMS; the other half will receive sham TMS.
* The first 10 participants will have additional tests to study the safety of rapid TMS in patients with Parkinson's disease.
* A day after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication as in the first assessment and respond to questions about mood, memory, and quality of life.
* One month after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication.",YES,Parkinson Disease,PROCEDURE: 50 HZ Repetitive TMS|PROCEDURE: Sham rTMS,"Gait Speed, Gait speed was assessed by measuring the time it takes to walk 10 meters. Subject's gait speed was measured while on medication and off medication for each group, i.e., real rTMS and sham rTMS. Two trials were averaged for each condition. Patients were instructed to walk fast without taking the risk of falling, wearing the same shoes and consistently using assistive devices if needed. Gait speed was measured at baseline and 1 day post intervention., Baseline, 1 day post rTMS","Bradykinesia, Bradykinesia refers to the slowness in executing a movement. Bradykinesia was assessed by measuring the time in seconds it takes to do the following sequence, 10 times: 1) hand closing and opening while squeezing a ball 2) elbow flexion 3) hand closing and opening, and 4) elbow extension. Subjects were allowed to practice these hand and arm movements until performance appeared not to get faster, and then abstained from further practice to minimize learning effects. The time it takes subjects to execute the entire sequence 10 times with either the left or right arm/hand was measured. Means are reported for each group., Baseline, 1 day post rTMS|Total UPDRS Score, The Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an overall assessment scale that quantifies the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

NCT04707378,Navigated Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Parkinson's Disease With Depression or Cognitive Impairment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04707378,,UNKNOWN,"Depressive symptoms are common non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease and seriously affect the quality of life and prognosis of patients. Currently, treatment measures for patients with Parkinson's disease with depression are mainly limited to pharmacotherapy, but the side effects of antidepressants and their interaction with anti-Parkinsonian drugs limit the use of pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a new painless and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that is commonly used in the treatment of depression. As the number of people with Parkinson's disease increases in China, the number of patients with Parkinson's disease and depression requiring rTMS treatment will also increase. The size and shape of individual brains, the distance between the stimulation coil and the responding neuronal tissue, and the location and orientation of anatomical structures are all different, and the use of common localization methods is usually limited by these individual anatomical differences. The traditional method relies on manual positioning of the coil, which is time-consuming and inefficient, and it is difficult to meet the requirements of position, angle, and coil orientation simultaneously. Studies have shown that the benefits of using navigation for rTMS treatment are up to twice as high as those of non-navigation methods. Therefore precise localization is a must for the future standardized application of rTMS in the development of patients with Parkinson's disease with depression. In this study, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with neuronavigation to treat patients with Parkinson's disease and depression, and reconstructed cephalometric models with individual cranial imaging data to individualize and precisely target stimulation sites, making rTMS more precise and effective in treating patients with Parkinson's disease and depression, and providing new avenues for further clinical and scientific research.",NO,Parkinson Disease|Depression|Cognitive Impairment,DEVICE: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation(rTMS),"Hamilton Depression Scale（HAMD）, The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) is a 24-item interviewer administered structure questionaire designed to assess symptoms of depression.

Little is known about the problems in brain function in focal hand dystonia (FHD) or complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) dystonia. It is unclear why some CRPS patients develop dystonia but others do not. Researchers want to learn which area of the brain is involved in CRPS dystonia compared with FHD.

Objectives:

To understand why people with CRPS develop dystonia, and if these reasons are different in people with FHD.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18 - 70 with CRPS dystonia OR with CRPS without dystonia OR with FHD and Healthy volunteers of similar age.

Design:

Participants will be screened with physical exam, neurological exam, and medical history. They may give a urine sample and will answer questions.

Participants can have 4 - 5 outpatient visits or stay at the clinical center for approximately 5-6 days.

Participants will have MRI scans. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a scanner that takes pictures of their brain. They will do small tasks or be asked to imagine things during the scanning.

Participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) sessions for a few hours, with breaks. A brief electrical current passing through a well insulated wire coil on the scalp creates a magnetic pulse. This affects brain activity. Participants may do small tasks during TMS.

Participants will have the electrical activity of their muscles measured during TMS sessions. Small sticky pads will be attached to their hands and arms.

NCT01189058,Modulation of Brain Plasticity After Perinatal Stroke,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01189058,PLASTIC CHAMPS,UNKNOWN,"Newborn stroke is the leading cause of a common type of cerebral palsy (CP) that affects thousands of Canadian children and families. Treatments for CP are generally ineffective, and have traditionally focused on the weak body rather than the injured brain. Understanding how the newborn brain responds to injuries like stroke (plasticity) carries the greatest potential for better treatments. We propose to study the ability of two interventions to modulate brain plasticity toward better function in children with stroke-induced CP. One is a rehabilitation method called constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), the other is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS is safe and comfortable for children and we recently showed it could improve motor function in children with stroke.

We will perform a special study to test both treatments simultaneously. Children 7-18 years with stroke-induced CP will be recruited into the study from across Alberta. Each child will randomly receive either TMS, CIMT, both, or neither each day for two weeks while attending our new HemiKids Power Camp for motor learning. Improvements will be measured by trained therapists over 1 year. TMS will also measure brain plasticity, both initially and following treatment. Our lead investigator is an expert in both newborn stroke and TMS and has assembled an experienced team of accomplished collaborators to ensure the completion of this important work. This will be the largest study of children with CP examined in this manner. This will be the first clinical trial of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) in CP, the largest trial of CIMT (and the first exclusive to newborn stroke), and the first study allowing the direct comparison of two different therapies. In establishing the first dedicated pediatric TMS laboratory in Canada, we will be the first to measure plasticity changes in newborn stroke, advancing new treatments of this previously untreatable and disabling disease.

Normal volunteers and patients with Parkinson's disease (stage I to III) 21 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.

All participants will have transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, an insulated wire coil is placed on the subject's scalp and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil. This creates a magnetic pulse that passes into the brain and generates very small electrical currents in the cortex, briefly disrupting the function of the brain cells in the stimulated area. This may cause muscle twitching or tingling in the face, jaw or limb. During the stimulation, participants will be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscle will be recorded on a computer through electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. In most cases, the study will last less than 3 hours. Participants will also fill out questionnaires about aspects of personality and will be tested for their ability to perform certain cognitive (thinking) and movement tasks. Patients with Parkinson's disease will, in addition, be administered the Uniform Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale to measure disease severity.

This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS, see below) to study how the brain plans movement.

Healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Healthy subjects may participate in one, two or three of the experiments described below. Patients with dystonia may participate in experiments one and three.

Before each experiment, each subject is asked about his/her medical and neurologic history, complete questionnaires and will undergo a brief physical examination.

Experiment 1

* Surface EMG: Small electrodes are taped to the skin over the arm to measure the electrical activity of muscles.
* TMS: A wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg, and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.

This leads to a high variance of HD markers, none of which is currently sensitive enough to 1) measure disease progression from small cohort data, 2) predict disease entry in carriers of the HD mutation (during the prodromal phase or in patients considered asymptomatic: pre-HD patients), and 3) measure a significant evolution of the state of pre-HD patients over a time window compatible with the realization of clinical trials (about 2/3 years). Moreover, the markers of HD do not allow a fine stratification of the patients.

Hypothesis/Objective Our objectives are 1) to evaluate the sensitivity of new markers and assessment tools for symptomatic (HD) and presymptomatic (pre-HD) patients, 2) to define a model of disease progression, and 3) to establish an enrichment strategy to improve patient selection for future therapeutic trials.

NCT05095740,Effects of Neuromodulation in Laryngeal Dystonia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05095740,,RECRUITING,"Laryngeal dystonia (LD) causes excessive vocal fold abduction (opening) or adduction (closing) leading to decreased voice quality, job prospects, self-worth and quality of life. Individuals with LD often experience episodic breathy voice, decreased ability to sustain vocal fold vibration, frequent pitch breaks and in some cases, vocal tremor. While neuroimaging investigations have uncovered both cortical organization and regional connectivity differences in structures in parietal, primary somatosensory and premotor cortices of those with LD, there remains a lack of understanding regarding how the brains of those with LD function to produce phonation and how these might differ from those without LD. Intervention options for people with LD are limited to general voice therapy techniques and Botulinum Toxin (Botox) injections to the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) and/or TA (thyroarytenoid) often bilaterally, to alleviate muscle spasms in the vocal folds. However, the effects of injections are short-lived, uncomfortable, and variable. To address this gap, the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique, in assessing cortical excitability and inhibition of laryngeal musculature. Previous work conducted by the investigator has demonstrated decreased intracortical inhibition in those with adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) compared to healthy controls. The investigators anticipate similar findings in individuals with with other forms of LD, where decreased cortical inhibition will likely be noted in the laryngeal motor cortex. Further, following low frequency (inhibitory) rTMS to the laryngeal motor brain area, it is anticipated that there will be a decrease in overactivation of the TA muscle. To test this hypothesis, a proof-of-concept, randomized study to down-regulate cortical motor signal to laryngeal muscles will be compared to those receiving an equal dose of sham rTMS.

Pharmacotherapy improves motor symptoms but has inconsistent effects on speech disturbance in PD patients. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a safe and non-invasive tool used for brain stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has positive effects on motor function of PD. Yet, its effect on speech disturbance seems to be inconclusive. Previous rTMS studies mainly focused on the primary motor cortex for PD speech disturbance. Nevertheless, we think supplementary motor area (SMA) may be a better target. Speech disturbance in PD may be associated with basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuits and SMA involves in the cortex part. In addition, neuroimaging studies showed that SMA were under-activation in PD patients. Therefore, we conduct this 3-year study including two experiments.

This study focuses on those with 'chronic' SCI - the injury occurred at least one year prior to enrolling.

This is a single center study taking place in the Bronx, NY.

The first phase of the study will be observational - the investigators will analyze which nerve connections might remain partially intact through the injury (even if the nerves aren't consciously controlled). Participants with all severity of SCI may participate in this first phase.

The second phase of the study will involve people who retain at least slight ability to move their legs and the ability to move the arms against gravity. Each person will undergo two different exercise rehabilitation strategies: weight-supported treadmill training; and balance training combined with skilled arm or hand exercises.

The investigators will compare the effects of these exercise programs on a variety of outcomes, including gait speed, balance, strength, and muscle activation in response to brain stimulation.

In this randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, the investigators will evaluate whether a two-weeks' treatment with cerebellar anodal tDCS and spinal cathodal tDCS can improve symptoms in patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia and can modulate cerebello-motor connectivity, at short and long term.",YES,"Ataxia, Cerebellar|Cerebellar Ataxia|Spinocerebellar Ataxias|Ataxia, Spinocerebellar|Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1|Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2|Spinocerebellar Ataxia 3|Spinocerebellar Degenerations|Friedreich Ataxia|Ataxia With Oculomotor Apraxia|Multiple System Atrophy",DEVICE: Anodal cerebellar and cathodal spinal tDCS|DEVICE: Sham cerebellar and sham spinal tDCS,"Change in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) Score From Baseline, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS): semi-quantitative 100-point scale, yielding a total score of 0 (no ataxia) to 100 (most severe ataxia)., Baseline - 2 weeks|Change in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) Score From Baseline, Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA): 8-item performance based scale, yielding a total score of 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia)., Baseline - 2 weeks","Change in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) Score From Baseline, International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS): semi-quantitative 100-point scale, yielding a total score of 0 (no ataxia) to 100 (most severe ataxia)., Baseline - 2 weeks - 1 month - 3 months|Change in the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) Score From Baseline, Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA): 8-item performance based scale, yielding a total score of 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia)., Baseline - 2 weeks - 1 month - 3 months|Change in the 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT) Score From Baseline, 4 timed trials of the 9 hole peg test (9HPT) were performed and averaged (mean values are reported) for each separate hand (dominant and nondominant).

NCT01651169,Methylphenidate on Intracortical Inhibition in Methamphetamine Abusers Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01651169,ADHD,UNKNOWN,"Previous studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with paired pulse protocols have shown that a conditioning TMS pulse applied to the human motor cortex changes the excitability of motor pathways from the motor cortex to spinal motorneurons. These effects depended on the stimulus intensity of both conditioning and test pulse and also the ISI). A characteristical sequence of inhibition (short interval cortical inhibition \[SICI\], GABA-Aerg), facilitation (intracortical facilitation \[ICF\]), and inhibition again (long interval cortical inhibition \[LICI\], GABA-Berg) is thought to be physiologically involved in motor control. Previous studies have also shown that neuronal inhibitory motor circuits are also disturbed in ADHD which will be restored by using methylphenidate. In this study the investigators sought to investigate if methamphetamine abuse (from the same chemical class of medications) will alter such effects of methylphenidate.",NO,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,OTHER: methylphenidate tablets and Inter-stimulus Intervals (ISI)|OTHER: methylphenidate tablets and Inter-stimulus Intervals (ISI),"Conners ADHD Rating Scale, The primary outcome measure for the study is Conners which measure clinical improvement on ADHD symptoms, 1 week","Change of Motor Evoked Potential (MEP), 1 week",,Tehran University of Medical Sciences,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,30,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: ",90-04-49-16359,2012-09,2015-11,2016-03,2012-07-26,,2014-11-18,"Javad Alaghband-rad, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of",
